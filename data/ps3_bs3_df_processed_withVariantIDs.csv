9634518,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of PAH deficiency correlate with PAH genotypes. We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories. We proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome. The observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79% of the cases, and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected. Among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4%-23% (P<.0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies. Our data indicate that the PAH-mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with PAH deficiency. In the present study, the classification of 105 PAH mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in >10,000 genotypes, which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns.",PS3,NM_000277.2:c.472C>T,2% mutant enzyme activity in BioPKU,,1,"Gene: PAH, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr12_102866633_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr12_103260411_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.102866633G>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.103260411G>A, rsID: rs75166491, HGVSc: c.472C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg158Trp, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R158W"
3615198,"Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene. The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. To determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5' splice donor site of intron 12. Thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during RNA splicing.",PS3,NM_000277.2:c.1315+1G>A,abolishes PAH activity due to protein instability,,1,"Gene: PAH, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr12_102840399_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr12_103234177_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.102840399C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.103234177C>T, rsID: rs5030861, HGVSc: c.1315+1G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"
15319459,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is characterized by reduction of blood phenylalanine level after a BH4-loading test. Most cases of BH4-responsive PAH deficiency include mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), but not all patients with mild PKU respond to BH4. We performed the phenylalanine breath test as reliable method to determine the BH4 responsiveness. Phenylalanine breath test quantitatively measures the conversion of L-[1-13C] phenylalanine to 13CO2 and is a noninvasive and rapid test. Twenty Japanese patients with HPA were examined with a dose of 10 mg/kg of 13C-phenylalanine with or without a dose of 10 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) of BH4 for 3 d. The phenylalanine breath test [cumulative recovery rate (CRR)] could distinguish control subjects (15.4 +/- 1.5%); heterozygotes (10.3 +/- 1.0%); and mild HPA (2.74%), mild PKU (1.13 +/- 0.14%), and classical PKU patients (0.29 +/- 0.14%). The genotypes in mild PKU cases were compound heterozygotes with mild (L52S, R241C, R408Q) and severe mutations, whereas a mild HPA case was homozygote of R241C. CRR correlated inversely with pretreatment phenylalanine levels, indicating the gene dosage effects on PKU. BH4 loading increased CRR from 1.13 +/- 0.14 to 2.95 +/- 1.14% (2.6-fold) in mild PKU and from 2.74 to 7.22% (2.6-fold) in mild HPA. A CRR of 5 to 6% reflected maintenance of appropriate serum phenylalanine level.

24401910,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is responsible for most cases of phenylketonuria (PKU). In this study of the PAH mutation spectrum in the Taiwanese population, 139 alleles were identified including 34 different mutations. The V190G, Q267R and F392I mutations are first reported in this study. The most common mutations, R241C, R408Q and Ex6-96A>G, account for 23.2%, 12.0% and 9.2%, of the mutant alleles, respectively. Haplotype analysis shows that R241C and Ex6-96A>G are exclusively associated with haplotype 4.3 to suggest founder effects. On the other hand, R408Q is found on two distinct haplotypes suggesting recurrent mutations. The spectrum of PAH mutations in Taiwan shows various links to those of other Asian regions, yet remarkable differences exist. Notably, R408Q, E286K and -4173_-407del, accounting for 21% of all mutant alleles in Taiwan, are very rare or are undetected among PKU cohorts of other Asian regions to suggest local founder effects. Moreover, the low homozygosity value of 0.092 hints at a high degree of ethnic heterogeneity within the Taiwanese population.

29706350,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in diverse cancers. Germline PTEN mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To empower new insights into PTEN function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of PTEN mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in vivo. Using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid PTEN variants (86% of possible). We identified 2,273 mutations with reduced cellular lipid phosphatase activity, which includes 1,789 missense mutations. These data recapitulated known functional findings but also uncovered new insights into PTEN protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. Several residues in the catalytic pocket showed surprising mutational tolerance. We identified that the solvent exposure of wild-type residues is a critical determinant of mutational tolerance. Further, we created a comprehensive functional map by leveraging correlations between amino acid substitutions to impute functional scores for all variants, including those not present in the assay. Variant functional scores can reliably discriminate likely pathogenic from benign alleles. Further, 32% of ClinVar unclassified missense variants are phosphatase deficient in our assay, supporting their reclassification. ASD-associated mutations generally had less severe fitness scores relative to PHTS-associated mutations (p = 7.16 × 10-5) and a higher fraction of hypomorphic mutations, arguing for continued genotype-phenotype studies in larger clinical datasets that can further leverage these rich functional data.",BS3_supporting,NM_000314.6:c.1052_1054delTAG,,In vitro or in vivo functional study or studies showing no damaging effect on protein function but BS3 not met.,1,"Gene: PTEN, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr10_87965309_CAGT_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr10_89725066_CAGT_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.87965312_87965314del, HGVSg (hg37): g.89725069_89725071del, rsID: rs587780003, HGVSc: c.1052_1054del, HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"
30993208,"Anti-PTEN monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are arising as important tools for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and protein quantification routine analysis in clinical oncology. Although an effort has been made to document the reliability of tumor tissue section immunostaining by anti-PTEN mAb, and to standardize their IHC use in research and in the clinical practice, the precise topological and biochemical definition of the epitope recognized by each mAb has been conventionally overlooked. In this study, six commercial anti-PTEN mAb have been validated and characterized for sensitivity and specificity by IHC and FISH, using a set of prostate and urothelial bladder tumor specimens, and by immunoblot, using PTEN positive and PTEN negative human cell lines. Immunoblot precise epitope mapping, performed using recombinant PTEN variants and mutations, revealed that all mAb recognized linear epitopes of 6-11 amino acid length at the PTEN C-terminus. Tumor-associated or disease-associated mutations at the PTEN C-terminus did not affect subcellular localization or PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in cells, although resulted in specific loss of reactivity for some mAb. Furthermore, specific mimicking-phosphorylation mutations at the PTEN C-terminal region also abolished binding of specific mAb. Our study adds new evidence on the relevance of a precise epitope mapping in the validation of anti-PTEN mAb for their use in the clinics.

29785012,"Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism.

Evidence-based classification of PTEN variants as either deleterious or benign is urgently needed for accurate molecular diagnosis and gene-informed genetic counseling. We studied 34 different germline PTEN intronic variants from 61 CS patients, characterized their PTEN mRNA processing, and analyzed PTEN expression and downstream readouts of P-AKT and P-ERK1/2. While we found that many mutations near splice junctions result in exon skipping, we also identified the presence of cryptic splicing that resulted in premature termination or a shift in isoform usage. PTEN protein expression is significantly lower in the group with splicing changes while P-AKT, but not P-ERK1/2, is significantly increased.

Variants inducing instability occur across the protein, resulting in partial-to-complete loss-of-function (LoF), which is well correlated across models. However, assays are selectively sensitive to variants located in substrate binding and catalytic domains, which exhibit complete LoF or dominant negativity independent of effects on stability.

Our studies revealed that five mutants were not secreted into the media: two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain mutants, which were not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates in cell lysates, and three LCCL domain mutants, which were detected as intracellular dimeric cochlins. Mutant cochlins that were not secreted and accumulated in cells result in earlier age of onset of hearing defects. In addition, individuals with LCCL domain mutations show accompanying vestibular dysfunction, whereas those with vWFA domain mutations exhibit predominantly hearing loss.

24829265,"RATIONALE: Approximately 40% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in β-cardiac myosin heavy chain (β-MHC). Associating disease phenotype with mutation is confounded by extensive background genetic and lifestyle/environmental differences between subjects even from the same family.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize disease caused by β-cardiac myosin heavy chain Val606Met substitution (VM) that has been identified in several HCM families with wide variation of clinical outcomes, in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Unlike 2 mouse lines bearing the malignant myosin mutations Arg453Cys (RC/+) or Arg719Trp (RW/+), VM/+ mice with an identical inbred genetic background lacked hallmarks of HCM such as left ventricular hypertrophy, disarray of myofibers, and interstitial fibrosis. Even homozygous VM/VM mice were indistinguishable from wild-type animals, whereas RC/RC- and RW/RW-mutant mice died within 9 days after birth. However, hypertrophic effects of the VM mutation were observed both in mice treated with cyclosporine, a known stimulator of the HCM response, and compound VM/RC heterozygous mice, which developed a severe HCM phenotype. In contrast to all heterozygous mutants, both systolic and diastolic function of VM/RC hearts was severely impaired already before the onset of cardiac remodeling.
CONCLUSIONS: The VM mutation per se causes mild HCM-related phenotypes; however, in combination with other HCM activators it exacerbates the HCM phenotype.

16983074,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leads to heart failure, a leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Approximately 30% of DCM cases are genetic in origin, with some resulting from point mutations in cardiac myosin, the molecular motor of the heart. The effects of these mutations on myosin's molecular mechanics have not been determined. We have engineered two murine models characterizing the physiological, cellular, and molecular effects of DCM-causing missense mutations (S532P and F764L) in the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain and compared them with WT mice. Mutant mice developed morphological and functional characteristics of DCM consistent with the human phenotypes. Contractile function of isolated myocytes was depressed and preceded left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening. In an in vitro motility assay, both mutant cardiac myosins exhibited a reduced ability to translocate actin (V(actin)) but had similar force-generating capacities. Actin-activated ATPase activities were also reduced. Single-molecule laser trap experiments revealed that the lower V(actin) in the S532P mutant was due to a reduced ability of the motor to generate a step displacement and an alteration of the kinetics of its chemomechanical cycle. These results suggest that the depressed molecular function in cardiac myosin may initiate the events that cause the heart to remodel and become pathologically dilated.",PS3,NM_000257.3:c.1594T>C,Mouse model indicates that this variant disrupts the function of MYH7 and leads to a phenotype consistent with DCM,,1,"Gene: MYH7, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr14_23427879_A_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr14_23897088_A_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.23427879A>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.23897088A>G, rsID: rs121913642, HGVSc: c.1594T>C, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Ser532Pro, HGVSp (1-letter): p.S532P"

We examined the contractile performance of chemically-skinned ventricular strips from two heterozygous murine models of DCM-causing missense mutations of myosin, F764L/+ and S532P/+, in an α-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) background. In Ca(2+)-activated skinned myocardial strips, the maximum developed tension in F764L/+ was only ~50% that of litter-mate controls (+/+). The F764L/+ also exhibited significantly reduced rigor stiffness, loaded shortening velocity and power output. Corresponding indices for S532P/+ strips were not different from controls. Manipulation of MgATP concentration in conjunction with measures of viscoelasticity, which provides estimates of myosin detachment rate 2πc, allowed us to probe the molecular basis of changes in crossbridge kinetics that occur with the myosin mutations. By examining the response of detachment rate to varying MgATP we found the rate of MgADP release was unaffected by the myosin mutations. However, MgATP binding rate was higher in the DCM groups compared to controls (422±109mM(-1)·s(-1) in F764L/+, 483±74mM(-1)·s(-1) in S532P/+ and 303±18mM(-1)·s(-1) in +/+).

Lack of robust functional assays has been a major hurdle in RAS pathway-targeted drug development. We used NMR to obtain detailed mechanistic data on RAS cycling defects conferred by oncogenic mutations, or full-length RASopathy-derived regulatory proteins. By monitoring the conformation of wild-type and oncogenic RAS in real-time, we show that opposing properties integrate with regulators to hyperactivate oncogenic RAS mutants. Q61L and G13D exhibited rapid nucleotide exchange and an unexpected susceptibility to GAP-mediated hydrolysis, in direct contrast with G12V, indicating different approaches must be taken to inhibit these oncoproteins.

By measuring GAP activity from tumor cells, we demonstrate how loss of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) increases RAS-GTP levels in NF1-derived cells. We further applied this methodology to profile Noonan Syndrome (NS)-derived SOS1 mutants. Combining NMR with cell-based assays allowed us to differentiate defects in catalysis, allosteric regulation, and membrane targeting of individual mutants, while revealing a membrane-dependent compensatory effect that attenuates dramatic increases in RAS activation shown by Y337C, L550P, and I252T.

Two disease-associated mutations, G12V and G12S, have previously been observed in patients with Costello syndrome (CS), and two other mutations, E63K and Q22K, are novel. All four mutations are predicted to enhance downstream HRas signalling, suggesting that CMEMS is a developmental consequence of sustained HRas activation in skeletal muscle.

21850009,"Costello syndrome (CS) is a congenital disease that is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, failure to thrive, mental retardation and cardiomyopathy. In 2005, we discovered that heterozygous germline mutations in HRAS caused CS. Several studies have shown that CS-associated HRAS mutations are clustered in codons 12 and 13, and mutations in other codons have also been identified. However, a comprehensive comparison of the substitutions identified in patients with CS has not been conducted. In the current study, we identified four mutations (p.G12S, p.G12A, p.G12C and p.G12D) in 21 patients and analyzed the associated clinical manifestations of CS in these individuals. To examine functional differences among the identified mutations, we characterized a total of nine HRAS mutants, including seven distinct substitutions in codons 12 and 13, p.K117R and p.A146T. The p.A146T mutant demonstrated the weakest Raf-binding activity, and the p.K117R and p.A146T mutants had weaker effects on downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling than did codon 12 or 13 mutants. We demonstrated that these mutant HRAS proteins induced senescence when overexpressed in human fibroblasts. Oncogene-induced senescence is a cellular reaction that controls cell proliferation in response to oncogenic mutation and it has been considered one of the tumor suppression mechanisms in vivo.

Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of SHP2. We found that the GAB1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both AKT and GSK-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing GAB1 expression or by overexpressing a GAB1 mutant unable to bind to PI3K. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate GAB1 PI3K-binding sites. These mutants induced PI3K-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes.

Although ERK dependence has been hypothesized to be a consistent feature across histiocytic neoplasms, this remains clinically unproven and many of the kinase mutations that are found in patients who lack BRAFV600 mutations have not previously been biologically characterized.

Moreover, the diagnosis of an individual initially thought to have NS was revised to neurofibromatosis type 1 based on an NF1 nonsense mutation detected in this patient. Another patient harbored a missense mutation in NF1 that resulted in decreased protein stability and impaired ability to suppress RAS-ERK activation; however, this patient continues to exhibit a NS-like phenotype. In addition, a nonsense mutation in RPS6KA3 was found in one patient initially diagnosed with NS whose diagnosis was later revised to Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Finally, we identified other potential candidates for new NS genes, as well as potential carrier alleles for unrelated syndromes. Taken together, our data suggest that next-generation sequencing can provide a useful adjunct to RASopathy diagnosis and emphasize that the standard clinical categories for RASopathies might not be adequate to describe all patients.",PS3,NM_002755.3:c.199G>A,In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Asp67Asn variant may impact protein function.,,1,"Gene: MAP2K1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr15_66435145_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr15_66727483_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.66435145G>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.66727483G>A, rsID: rs727504317, HGVSc: c.199G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Asp67Asn, HGVSp (1-letter): p.D67N"
23093928,"Gauging the systemic effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) is an important topic in the pursuit of personalized medicine. However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior.

Children born with germ-line mutations in BRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 develop cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, skin and hair abnormalities and mental retardation. CFC syndrome mutations in BRAF promote both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired variants. CFC syndrome has a progressive phenotype, and the availability of clinically active inhibitors of the MAPK pathway prompts the important question as to whether such inhibitors might be therapeutically effective in the treatment of CFC syndrome. To study the developmental effects of CFC mutant alleles in vivo, we have expressed a panel of 28 BRAF and MEK alleles in zebrafish embryos to assess the function of human disease alleles and available chemical inhibitors of this pathway. We find that both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired CFC mutant alleles promote the equivalent developmental outcome when expressed during early development and that treatment of CFC-zebrafish embryos with inhibitors of the FGF-MAPK pathway can restore normal early development.

Such transcripts might encode mutant proteins with trans-dominant negative effects. We found that CDH1 is highly expressed at 4 and 5 weeks in the frontonasal prominence, and at 6 weeks in the lateral and medial nasal prominences of human embryos, and is therefore expressed during the critical stages of lip and palate development.

In this report, we describe a germline CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant identified in a 50 year old man who was diagnosed with gastric cancer with a strong family history of gastric cancer (one living brother was diagnosed with gastric cancer at 63 and another brother died of gastric cancer at 45). cDNA analysis, involving fragment analysis and cloning, indicated that the p.T560R mutation created a novel 5' splice donor site, which led to a novel transcript with a 32 nucleotide deletion in exon 11. This abnormal transcript putatively produces a truncated CDH1 protein (E-cadherin) of 575 amino acids instead of 882. We also demonstrated that the variant completely abolishes normal splicing as the mutant allele does not generate any normal transcript. Furthermore, the CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant segregated with gastric cancer in all three family members affected with gastric cancer in this family.

However, even with a sufficient amount of E-cadherin, cell-cell adhesion is sometimes lost in ""diffusely invasive"" human carcinomas. Ten human cancer cell lines, showing growth characterized morphologically by loose cell-cell adhesion, were analyzed for possible structural abnormalities of their expressed E-cadherin. Four of the cell lines showed strong mRNA and protein expression with no nucleotide sequence abnormalities, and mRNA was absent in four other cell lines. mRNA sequence was abnormal in the remaining two gastric carcinoma cell lines. In MKN45 (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma), this involved a 12-bp in-frame deletion with strong expression of mRNA and protein. In KATO-III (signet ring cell carcinoma), there were four mRNA species with insertions of different sizes, among which the major transcripts (with a 7-bp insertion) caused a frameshift, and expression of both mRNA and protein was markedly reduced. In these two cell lines, DNA mutations were detected around exon-intron junctions, revealing that aberrant RNA splicing was the cause of the mRNA abnormalities.

9537325,"The identification of genes predisposing to familial cancer is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families. Despite a declining incidence, gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer death worldwide, and about 10% of cases show familial clustering. The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric cancer are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric cancer. Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset, histologically poorly differentiated, high grade, diffuse gastric cancer in a large kindred from New Zealand (Aotearoa). Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin. Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7, leading to a truncated gene product. Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinomas. Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types, and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells. The role of E-cadherin in gastric cancer susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric cancer families. In one family, a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15, and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13.

15235021,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations.
METHODS: Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing.
RESULTS: Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families.
CONCLUSION: Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age.

26579216,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in social communication/interaction and inflexible/repetitive behavior. Several lines of evidence support genetic factors as a predominant cause of ASD. Among those autism susceptibility genes that have been identified, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, initially identified as predisposing to Cowden heritable cancer syndrome, was found to be mutated in a subset of ASD patients with extreme macrocephaly. However, the ASD-relevant molecular mechanism mediating the effect of PTEN mutations remains elusive.
METHODS: We developed a Pten knock-in murine model to study the effects of Pten germline mutations, specifically altering subcellular localization, in ASD. Proteins were isolated from the hemispheres of the male littermates, and Western blots were performed to determine protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Immunohistochemical stains were carried out to validate the localization of TH and dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). PC12 cells ectopically expressing either wild-type or missense mutant PTEN were then compared for the differences in TH expression.
RESULTS: Mice carrying Pten mutations have high TH and D2R in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. They also have increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and TH. Mechanistically, PTEN downregulates TH production in PC12 cells via inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/CREB signaling pathway, while PTEN reduces TH phosphorylation via suppressing MAPK pathway. Unlike wild-type PTEN but similar to the mouse knock-in mutant Pten, three naturally occurring missense mutations of PTEN that we previously identified in ASD patients, H93R, F241S, and D252G, were not able to suppress TH when overexpressed in PC12 cells. In addition, two other PTEN missense mutations, C124S (pan phosphatase dead) and G129E (lipid phosphatase dead), failed to suppress TH when ectopically expressed in PC12 cells.

Here, human PTEN is shown to be on the cusp of unfolding under physiological conditions. Variants of human PTEN linked to somatic cancers and disorders on the autism spectrum are shown to be impaired in their conformational stability, catalytic activity, or both. Those variants linked only to autism have activity higher than the activity of those linked to cancers.

20718038,"The tumor suppressor, phosphatase, and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), is a phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase specific for the 3-position of the inositol ring. PTEN has been implicated in autism for a subset of patients with macrocephaly. Various studies identified patients in this subclass with one normal and one mutated PTEN gene. We characterize the binding, structural properties, activity, and subcellular localization of one of these autism-related mutants, H93R PTEN. Even though this mutation is located at the phosphatase active site, we find that it affects the functions of neighboring domains. H93R PTEN binding to phosphatidylserine-bearing model membranes is 5.6-fold enhanced in comparison to wild-type PTEN. In contrast, we find that binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) model membranes is 2.5-fold decreased for the mutant PTEN in comparison to wild-type PTEN. The structural change previously found for wild-type PTEN upon interaction with PI(4,5)P(2), is absent for H93R PTEN. Consistent with the increased binding to phosphatidylserine, we find enhanced plasma membrane association of PTEN-GFP in U87MG cells. However, this enhanced plasma membrane association does not translate into increased PI(3,4,5)P(3) turnover, since in vivo studies show a reduced activity of the H93R PTEN-GFP mutant. Because the interaction of PI(4,5)P(2) with PTEN's N-terminal domain is diminished by this mutation, we hypothesize that the interaction of PTEN's N-terminal domain with the phosphatase domain is impacted by the H93R mutation, preventing PI(4,5)P(2) from inducing the conformational change that activates phosphatase activity.",PS3_supporting,NM_000314.6:c.278A>G,Abnormal in vitro cellular assay or transgenic model with phenotype different from wild type that does not meet PS3.,,1,"Gene: PTEN, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr10_87933037_A_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr10_89692794_A_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.87933037A>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.89692794A>G, rsID: rs121909238, HGVSc: c.278A>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.His93Arg, HGVSp (1-letter): p.H93R"

PTEN is mutated in a subset of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the mechanism by which specific point mutations alter PTEN function is largely unknown. Here, we assessed how ASD-associated single-nucleotide variations in PTEN (ASD-PTEN) affect function.
METHODS: We used viral-mediated molecular substitution of human PTEN into Pten knockout mouse neurons and assessed neuronal morphology to determine the functional impact of ASD-PTEN. We employed molecular cloning to examine how PTEN's stability, subcellular localization, and catalytic activity affect neuronal growth.
RESULTS: We identified a set of ASD-PTEN mutations displaying altered lipid phosphatase function and subcellular localization. We demonstrated that wild-type PTEN can rescue the neuronal hypertrophy, while PTEN H93R, F241S, D252G, W274L, N276S, and D326N failed to rescue this hypertrophy. A subset of these mutations lacked nuclear localization, prompting us to examine the role of nuclear PTEN in regulating neuronal growth. We found that nuclear PTEN alone is sufficient to regulate soma size. Furthermore, forced localization of the D252G and W274L mutations into the nucleus partially restores regulation of soma size.
CONCLUSIONS: ASD-PTEN mutations display decreased stability, catalytic activity, and/or altered subcellular localization.

Mutations in the three known genes of the KCNQ branch of the K+ channel gene family underlie inherited cardiac arrhythmias (in some cases associated with deafness) and neonatal epilepsy. We have now cloned KCNQ4, a novel member of this branch. It maps to the DFNA2 locus for a form of nonsyndromic dominant deafness. In the cochlea, it is expressed in sensory outer hair cells. A mutation in this gene in a DFNA2 pedigree changes a residue in the KCNQ4 pore region. It abolishes the potassium currents of wild-type KCNQ4 on which it exerts a strong dominant-negative effect.

18786918,"M-type K(+) channels, consisting of KCNQ1-5 (Kv7.1-7.5) subunits, form a variety of homomeric and heteromeric channels. Whereas all the subunits can assemble into homomeric channels, the ability of the subunits to assemble into heteromultimers is highly variable. KCNQ3 is widely thought to co-assemble with several other KCNQ subtypes, whereas KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 do not. However, the existence of other subunit assemblies is not well studied. To systematically explore the heteromeric assembly of KCNQ channels in individual living cells, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged KCNQ subunits expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in which excitation light only penetrates several hundred nanometers into the cell, thus isolating membrane events. We found significant FRET between homomeric subunits as expected from their functional expression in heterologous expression systems. Also as expected from previous work, robust FRET was observed between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. KCNQ3 and KCNQ4 also showed substantial FRET as did KCNQ4 and KCNQ5. To determine functional assembly of KCNQ4/KCNQ5 heteromers, we performed two types of experiments. In the first, we constructed a mutant tetraethylammonium ion-sensitive KCNQ4 subunit and tested its assembly with KCNQ5 by patch clamp analysis of the tetraethylammonium ion sensitivity of the resulting current; however, those data were not conclusive. In the second, we co-expressed a KCNQ4 (G285S) pore mutant with KCNQ5 and found the former to act as a dominant negative, suggesting co-assembly of the two types of subunits.

21953985,"A previous computational analysis of missense mutations linked to monogenic disease found a high proportion of missense mutations affect protein stability, rather than other aspects of protein structure and function. The purpose of this study is to relate the presence of such stability damaging missense mutations to the levels of a particular protein present under ""in vivo"" like conditions, and to test the reliability of the computational methods. Experimental data on a set of missense mutations of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) associated with the monogenic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) have been compared with the expected in vivo impact on protein function, obtained using SNPs3D, an in silico analysis package. A high proportion of the PAH mutations are predicted to be destabilizing. The overall agreement between predicted stability impact and experimental evidence for lower protein levels is in accordance with the estimated error rates of the methods. For these mutations, destabilization of protein three-dimensional structure is the major molecular mechanism leading to PKU, and results in a substantial reduction of in vivo PAH protein concentration. Although of limited scale, the results support the view that destabilization is the most common mechanism by which missense mutations cause monogenic disease.

Here we describe methodology permitting fusion gene construction for functional evaluation. Using this strategy, we engineered the known fusion oncogenes, BCR-ABL1, EML4-ALK, and ETV6-NTRK3, as well as 20 previously uncharacterized fusion genes identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In addition to confirming oncogenic activity of the known fusion oncogenes engineered by our construction strategy, we validated five novel fusion genes involving MET, NTRK2, and BRAF kinases that exhibited potent transforming activity and conferred sensitivity to FDA-approved kinase inhibitors. Our fusion construction strategy also enabled domain-function studies of BRAF fusion genes. Our results confirmed other reports that the transforming activity of BRAF fusions results from truncation-mediated loss of inhibitory domains within the N-terminus of the BRAF protein. BRAF mutations residing within this inhibitory region may provide a means for BRAF activation in cancer, therefore we leveraged the modular design of our fusion gene construction methodology to screen N-terminal domain mutations discovered in tumors that are wild-type at the BRAF mutation hotspot, V600. We identified an oncogenic mutation, F247L, whose expression robustly activated the MAPK pathway and sensitized cells to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

15834506,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by short stature, characteristic facial features, and heart defects. Recently, missense mutations of PTPN11, the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-2, were identified in patients with NS. Further, somatic mutations in PTPN11 were detected in childhood leukemia. Recent studies showed that the phosphatase activities of five mutations identified in NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) were increased. However, the functional properties of the other mutations remain unidentified. In this study, in order to clarify the differences between the mutations identified in NS and leukemia, we examined the phosphatase activity of 14 mutants of SHP-2. We identified nine mutations, including a novel F71I mutation, in 16 of 41 NS patients and two mutations, including a novel G503V mutation, in three of 29 patients with leukemia. Immune complex phosphatase assays of individual mutants transfected in COS7 cells showed that ten mutants identified in NS and four mutants in leukemia showed 1.4-fold to 12.7-fold increased activation compared with wild-type SHP-2. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of NS and leukemia is associated with enhanced phosphatase activity of mutant SHP-2.

18372317,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS.",PS3,NM_002834.5:c.417G>C,In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Glu139Asp variant may impact protein function,,1,"Gene: PTPN11, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr12_112453279_G_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr12_112891083_G_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.112453279G>C, HGVSg (hg37): g.112891083G>C, rsID: rs397507520, HGVSc: c.417G>C, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Glu139Asp, HGVSp (1-letter): p.E139D"
24935154,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is a critical signal transducer downstream of growth factors that promotes the activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 cascade. In its basal state, SHP2 exists in an autoinhibited closed conformation because of an intramolecular interaction between its N-SH2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains. Binding to pTyr ligands present on growth factor receptors and adaptor proteins with its N-SH2 domain localizes SHP2 to its substrates and frees the active site from allosteric inhibition. Germline mutations in SHP2 are known to cause both Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS), two clinically similar autosomal dominant developmental disorders. NS-associated SHP2 mutants display elevated phosphatase activity, while LS-associated SHP2 mutants exhibit reduced catalytic activity. A conundrum in how clinically similar diseases result from mutations to SHP2 that have opposite effects on this enzyme's catalytic functionality exists. Here we report a comprehensive investigation of the kinetic, structural, dynamic, and biochemical signaling properties of the wild type as well as all reported LS-associated SHP2 mutants. The results reveal that LS-causing mutations not only affect SHP2 phosphatase activity but also induce a weakening of the intramolecular interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains, leading to mutants that are more readily activated by competing pTyr ligands. Our data also indicate that the residual phosphatase activity associated with the LS SHP2 mutant is required for enhanced ERK1/2 activation. Consequently, catalytically impaired SHP2 mutants could display gain-of-function properties because of their ability to localize to the vicinity of substrates for longer periods of time, thereby affording the opportunity for prolonged substrate turnover and sustained RAS-ERK1/2 activation.",PS3,NM_002834.4:c.1403C>T,In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Thr468Met variant may impact protein function,,1,"Gene: PTPN11, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr12_112488466_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr12_112926270_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.112488466C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.112926270C>T, rsID: rs121918457, HGVSc: c.1403C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Thr468Met, HGVSp (1-letter): p.T468M"

Biochemical analyses indicated that LS alleles engender loss-of-function (LOF) effects, while NS mutations result in gain-of-function (GOF). These biochemical findings lead to an enigma that how PTPN11 mutations with opposite effects on function result in disorders that are so similar. To study the developmental effects of the commonest LS PTPN11 alleles (Y279C and T468M), we generated LS transgenic fruitflies using corkscrew (csw), the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. Ubiquitous expression of the LS csw mutant alleles resulted in ectopic wing veins and, for the Y279C allele, rough eyes with increased R7 photoreceptor numbers. These were GOF phenotypes mediated by increased RAS/MAPK signaling and requiring the LS mutant's residual phosphatase activity.

We provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the N-SH2 domain. Most mutations affecting Tyr(63) exerted an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding cleft mediating the interaction of SHP2 with signaling partners. Among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease-causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of the inactive conformation of SHP2 without severely impairing proper phosphopeptide binding of N-SH2. On the other hand, the disruptive effect of the Y62D change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant. Overall, our data demonstrate that the selection-by-function mechanism acting as driving force for PTPN11 mutations affecting codons 62 and 63 implies balancing of counteracting effects operating on the allosteric control of the function of SHP2.",PS3,NM_002834.5:c.188A>G,In-vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Tyr63Cys variant may impact protein function,,1,"Gene: PTPN11, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr12_112450368_A_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr12_112888172_A_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.112450368A>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.112888172A>G, rsID: rs121918459, HGVSc: c.188A>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Tyr63Cys, HGVSp (1-letter): p.Y63C"
23967136,"Human Connexin26 gene mutations cause hearing loss. These hereditary mutations are the leading cause of childhood deafness worldwide. Mutations in gap junction proteins (connexins) can impair intercellular communication by eliminating protein synthesis, mis-trafficking, or inducing channels that fail to dock or have aberrant function.

Here we analyzed fourteen point mutations in the fourth transmembrane helix of connexin26 (Cx26) that cause non-syndromic hearing loss. Eight mutations caused mis-trafficking (K188R, F191L, V198M, S199F, G200R, I203K, L205P, T208P). Of the remaining six that formed gap junctions in mammalian cells, M195T and A197S formed stable hemichannels after isolation with a baculovirus/Sf9 protein purification system, while C202F, I203T, L205V and N206S formed hemichannels with varying degrees of instability. The function of all six gap junction-forming mutants was further assessed through measurement of dye coupling in mammalian cells and junctional conductance in paired Xenopus oocytes. Dye coupling between cell pairs was reduced by varying degrees for all six mutants. In homotypic oocyte pairings, only A197S induced measurable conductance. In heterotypic pairings with wild-type Cx26, five of the six mutants formed functional gap junction channels, albeit with reduced efficiency. None of the mutants displayed significant alterations in sensitivity to transjunctional voltage or induced conductive hemichannels in single oocytes. Intra-hemichannel interactions between mutant and wild-type proteins were assessed in rescue experiments using baculovirus expression in Sf9 insect cells. Of the four unstable mutations (C202F, I203T, L205V, N206S) only C202F and N206S formed stable hemichannels when co-expressed with wild-type Cx26.

23848403,"BACKGROUND: Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by thrombocytopenia and abnormal platelet function. Causal mutations have been identified in the gene encoding runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) of FPD patients.
OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of RUNX1 in the regulation of expression of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and to propose a plausible mechanism underlying RUNX1-mediated induction of the FPD phenotype.
METHODS: We assessed whether RUNX1 and its mutants, in combination with E26 transformation-specific-1 (ETS-1), Core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFβ), and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1), cooperatively regulate PF4 expression during megakaryocytic differentiation. In an embryonic stem cell differentiation system, expression levels of endogenous and exogenous RUNX1 and PF4 were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Promoter activation by the transcription factors were evaluated by reporter gene assays with HepG2 cells. DNA binding activity and protein interaction were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation assay with Cos-7 cells, respectively. Protein localization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting with Cos-7 cells.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that RUNX1 activates endogenous PF4 expression in megakaryocytic differentiation. RUNX1, but not its mutants, in combination with ETS-1 and CBFβ, or FLI-1, synergistically activated the PF4 promoter.

Sporadic mono- and biallelic mutations are found at high frequencies in AML M0, in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and AML, and in isolated cases of AML M2, M5a, M3 relapse, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles.

In the present study, we evaluate the applicability of transactivation assays to investigate RUNX1 variants in different regions of the protein. We studied 11 variants to independently validate transactivation assays supporting variant classification following the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancies Variant Curation Expert Panel guidelines. Variant classification is key for the translation of genetic findings. We showed that new assays need to be developed to assess C-terminal RUNX1 variants. Two variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were reclassified to likely pathogenic. Additionally, our analyses supported the (likely) pathogenic classification of 2 other variants. We demonstrated functionality of 4 VUS, but reclassification to (likely) benign was challenging and suggested the need for reevaluating current classification guidelines. Finally, clinical utility of our assays was illustrated in the context of 7 families. Our data confirmed RUNX1-FPD suspicion in 3 families with RUNX1-FPD-specific family history, whereas for 3 variants identified in RUNX1-FPD-nonspecific families, no functional defect was detected.

Recently, we showed that RUNX1 physically and functionally interacts with MLL, thereby regulating the epigenetic status of critical cis-regulatory elements for hematopoietic genes. This newly unveiled interaction between the two most prevalent leukemia genes has solved a long-standing conundrum: leukemia-associated RUNX1 N-terminal point mutants that exhibit no obvious functional abnormalities in classical assays for the assessment of transcriptional activities. These mutants turned out to be defective in MLL interaction and subsequent epigenetic modifications that can be examined by the histone-modification status of cis-regulatory elements in the target genes. RUNX1/MLL binding confirms the importance of RUNX1 function as an epigenetic regulator. Recent studies employing next-generation sequencing on human hematological malignancies identified a plethora of mutations in epigenetic regulator genes.

26845104,"PURPOSE: Screening multiple genes for inherited cancer predisposition expands opportunities for cancer prevention; however, reports of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) may limit clinical usefulness. We used an expert-driven approach, exploiting all available information, to evaluate multigene panels for inherited cancer predisposition in a clinical series that included multiple cancer types and complex family histories.
METHODS: For 1,462 sequential patients referred for testing by BROCA or ColoSeq multigene panels, genomic DNA was sequenced and variants were interpreted by multiple experts using International Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines and incorporating evolutionary conservation, known and predicted variant consequences, and personal and family cancer history. Diagnostic yield was evaluated for various presenting conditions and family-history profiles.
RESULTS: Of 1,462 patients, 12% carried damaging mutations in established cancer genes. Diagnostic yield varied by clinical presentation. Actionable results were identified for 13% of breast and colorectal cancer patients and for 4% of cancer-free subjects, based on their family histories of cancer. Incidental findings explaining cancer in neither the patient nor the family were present in 1.7% of subjects. Less than 1% of patients carried VUS in BRCA1 or BRCA2. For all genes combined, initial reports contained VUS for 10.5% of patients, which declined to 7.5% of patients after reclassification based on additional information.

17339331,"Proper regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways is critical for normal development and the prevention of cancer. SOS is a dual-function guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that catalyzes exchange on Ras and Rac. Although the physiologic role of SOS and its CDC25 domain in RTK-mediated Ras activation is well established, the in vivo function of its Dbl Rac GEF domain is less clear. We have identified a novel gain-of-function missense mutation in the Dbl domain of Caenorhabditis elegans SOS-1 that promotes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in vivo. Our data indicate that a major developmental function of the Dbl domain is to inhibit EGF-dependent MAPK activation. The amount of inhibition conferred by the Dbl domain is equal to that of established trans-acting inhibitors of the EGFR pathway, including c-Cbl and RasGAP, and more than that of MAPK phosphatase. In conjunction with molecular modeling, our data suggest that the C. elegans mutation, as well as an equivalent mutation in human SOS1, activates the MAPK pathway by disrupting an autoinhibitory function of the Dbl domain on Ras activation.

To gain a systematic view of p53 function, we interrogated loss-of-function screens conducted in hundreds of human cancer cell lines and performed TP53 saturation mutagenesis screens in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type and null cell lines. We found that loss or dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type p53 function reliably enhanced cellular fitness. By integrating these data with the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures database9,10, we developed a statistical model that describes the TP53 mutational spectrum as a function of the baseline probability of acquiring each mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by attenuation of p53 activity.

Here, we characterized the germline OD mutant p53(A347D), which occurs in cancer-prone Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients. Unlike wild-type p53, mutant p53(A347D) cannot form tetramers and exists as a hyperstable dimeric protein. Further, p53(A347D) cannot bind or transactivate the majority of canonical p53 target genes. Isogenic cell lines harboring either p53(A347D) or no p53 yield comparable tumorigenic properties, yet p53(A347D) displays remarkable neomorphic activities. Cells bearing p53(A347D) possess a distinct transcriptional profile and undergo metabolic reprogramming. Further, p53(A347D) induces striking mitochondrial network aberration and associates with mitochondria to drive apoptotic cell death upon topoisomerase II inhibition in the absence of transcription. Thus, dimer-forming p53 demonstrates both loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) properties compared with the wild-type form of the protein.
SIGNIFICANCE: A mutant p53 (A347D), which can only form dimers, is associated with increased cancer susceptibility in LFS individuals.

Importantly, total expression levels of all of the functionally affected protein variants were significantly reduced with respect to the wild-type and a fully functional variant (p.R776C), regardless of their subcellular localization. Interestingly, reduction of expression may also reduce the transport activity of variants with an intrinsic gain of function (p.Q413R).

We previously reported that bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations are associated with Pendred syndromic EVA whereas one or zero mutant alleles are associated with nonsyndromic EVA. One study proposed a correlation of nonsyndromic EVA with SLC26A4 alleles encoding pendrin with residual transport activity. Here we describe the phenotypes and SLC26A4 genotypes of 47 EVA patients ascertained since our first report of 39 patients.

To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene.

22252923,"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease using recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) has resulted in increased survival although the clinical response is variable. Cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative status has been recognized as a poor prognostic factor. CRIM-negative patients make no GAA protein and develop sustained high antibody titers to ERT that render the treatment ineffective. Antibody titers are generally low for the majority of CRIM-positive patients and there is typically a better clinical outcome. Because immunomodulation has been found to be most effective in CRIM-negative patients prior to, or shortly after, initiation of ERT, knowledge of CRIM status is important before ERT is begun. We have analyzed 243 patients with infantile Pompe disease using a Western blot method for determining CRIM status and using cultured skin fibroblasts. Sixty-one out of 243 (25.1%) patients tested from various ethnic backgrounds were found to be CRIM-negative.

23430493,"Pompe disease (PD) is a recessive metabolic disorder characterized by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in all tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. PD clinical course is mainly determined by the nature of the GAA mutations. Although ~400 distinct GAA sequence variations have been described, the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always evident.In this study, we describe the first clinical and genetic analysis of Colombian PD patients performed in 11 affected individuals. GAA open reading frame sequencing revealed eight distinct mutations related to PD etiology including two novel missense mutations, c.1106 T > C (p.Leu369Pro) and c.2236 T > C (p.Trp746Arg). In vitro functional studies showed that the structural changes conferred by both mutations did not inhibit the synthesis of the 110 kD GAA precursor form but affected the processing and intracellular transport of GAA. In addition, analysis of previously described variants located at this position (p.Trp746Gly, p.Trp746Cys, p.Trp746Ser, p.Trp746X) revealed new insights in the molecular basis of PD. Notably, we found that p.Trp746Cys mutation, which was previously described as a polymorphism as well as a causal mutation, displayed a mild deleterious effect.

25348715,"A new model of kinase regulation based on the assembly of hydrophobic spines has been proposed. Changes in their positions can explain the mechanism of kinase activation. Here, we examined mutations in human cancer for clues about the regulation of the hydrophobic spines by focusing initially on mutations to Phe. We identified a selected number of Phe mutations in a small group of kinases that included BRAF, ABL1, and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Testing some of these mutations in BRAF, we found that one of the mutations impaired ATP binding and catalytic activity but promoted noncatalytic allosteric functions. Other Phe mutations functioned to promote constitutive catalytic activity. One of these mutations revealed a previously underappreciated hydrophobic surface that functions to position the dynamic regulatory αC-helix. This supports the key role of the C-helix as a signal integration motif for coordinating multiple elements of the kinase to create an active conformation. The importance of the hydrophobic space around the αC-helix was further tested by studying a V600F mutant, which was constitutively active in the absence of the negative charge that is associated with the common V600E mutation.

However, no rigorous method to overlay this information onto the cancer exome exists. Here, we present a computational methodology that overlays any variant database onto the somatic mutations in all cancer exomes.

28301459,"PURPOSE: Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by eyelid malformations, cleft lip/palate, and ectodermal dysplasia. The molecular basis of BCD syndrome remains unknown.
METHODS: We recruited 11 patients from 8 families and performed exome sequencing for 5 families with de novo BCD syndrome cases and targeted Sanger sequencing in the 3 remaining families.
RESULTS: We identified five CDH1 heterozygous missense mutations and three CTNND1 heterozygous truncating mutations leading to loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency. Establishment of detailed genotype-phenotype correlations was not possible because of the size of the cohort; however, the phenotype seems to appear more severe in case of CDH1 mutations. Functional analysis of CDH1 mutations confirmed their deleterious impact and suggested accelerated E-cadherin degradation.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in CDH1 encoding the E-cadherin were previously reported in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer as well as in nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate. Mutations in CTNND1 have never been reported before. The encoded protein, p120ctn, prevents E-cadherin endocytosis and stabilizes its localization at the cell surface. Conditional deletion of Cdh1 and Ctnnd1 in various animal models induces features reminiscent of BCD syndrome and underlines critical role of the E-cadherin-p120ctn interaction in eyelid, craniofacial, and tooth development. Our data assert BCD syndrome as a CDH1 pathway-related disorder due to mutations in CDH1 and CTNND1 and widen the phenotypic spectrum of E-cadherin anomalies.Genet Med advance online publication 09 March 2017.",PS3_supporting,NM_004360.5:c.1320+1G>C,"Splicing analysis in vitro has shown that the C allele results in skipping of exon 9, producing an abnormal in-frame transcript",,1,"Gene: CDH1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr16_68813496_G_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr16_68847399_G_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.68813496G>C, HGVSg (hg37): g.68847399G>C, rsID: rs886039685, HGVSc: c.1320+1G>C, HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"
17924342,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Most missense mutations result in misfolding of PAH, increased protein turnover, and a loss of enzymatic function. We studied the prediction of the energetic impact on PAH native-state stability of 318 PKU-associated missense mutations, using the protein-design algorithm FoldX. For the 80 mutations for which expression analyses have been performed in eukaryote systems, in most cases we found substantial overall correlations between the mutational energetic impact and both in vitro residual activities and patient metabolic phenotype. This finding confirmed that the decrease in protein stability is the main molecular pathogenic mechanism in PKU and the determinant for phenotypic outcome. Metabolic phenotypes have been shown to be better predicted than in vitro residual activities, probably because of greater stringency in the phenotyping process. Finally, all the remaining 238 PKU missense mutations compiled at the PAH locus knowledgebase (PAHdb) were analyzed, and their phenotypic outcomes were predicted on the basis of the energetic impact provided by FoldX. Residues in exons 7-9 and in interdomain regions within the subunit appear to play an important structural role and constitute hotspots for destabilization. FoldX analysis will be useful for predicting the phenotype associated with rare or new mutations detected in patients with PKU.

19691478,"BACKGROUND: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive inherited platelet function defect that is characterized by reduction in, or absence of, platelet aggregation in response to multiple physiologic agonists. The defect is caused by mutations in the genes encoding ITGA2B or ITGB3. This results in qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of the platelet receptor, alpha IIb-beta 3.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the mutations in GT patients and to correlate these with patient phenotype.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 unrelated patients with GT were enrolled in the present study to identify the causative molecular defects, and also to correlate their phenotype with their genotype. Platelet aggregation, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and mutation screening by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing were performed in all patients. Novel mutations were analyzed for penetrance in individual families.
RESULTS: A total of 22 novel mutations were identified in 45 unrelated GT patients. Mutations were identified in 36 of the 45 (80%) patients. Missense mutations were seen in most of the GT patients (59%). The remaining mutations were heterogeneous and were distributed throughout the length of the gene. Analysis of family members showed heterozygous mutations in all families.

14690453,"Chemical or enzymic reduction/oxidation of integrin cysteine residues (e.g. by reducing agents and protein disulphide isomerase) may be a mechanism for regulating integrin function. It has also been proposed that unique cysteine residues in the integrin beta3 subunit are involved in the regulation of alphaIIbbeta3. In the present study, we studied systematically the role of disulphide bonds in beta3 on the ligand-binding function of alphaIIbbeta3 by mutating individual cysteine residues of beta3 to serine. We found that the disulphide bonds that are critical for alphaIIbbeta3 regulation are clustered within the EGF (epidermal growth factor) domains. Interestingly, disrupting only a single disulphide bond in the EGF domains was enough to activate alphaIIbbeta3 fully. In contrast, only two (of 13) disulphide bonds tested outside the EGF domains activated alphaIIbbeta3. These results suggest that the disulphide bonds in the EGF domains should be intact to keep alphaIIbbeta3 in an inactive state, and that there is no unique cysteine residue in the EGF domain critical for regulating the receptor.

Little is known of how amino acid substitutions of β3 comparatively affect the expression and structure of both integrins.

In contrast, for αvβ3, S163 has different effects with β3R261 coming deeper into the propeller with a 43% increase in intra-subunit H-bonds but with little effect on the global H-bond network.

Based on sequence conservation, MAF, and location on a complete model of αIIbβ3, we selected three novel variants that affect amino acids previously associated with GT for expression in HEK293 cells. αIIb P176H and β3 C547G severely reduced αIIbβ3 expression, whereas αIIb P943A partially reduced αIIbβ3 expression and had no effect on fibrinogen binding. We used receiver operating characteristic curves of combined annotation-dependent depletion, Polyphen 2-HDIV, and sorting intolerant from tolerant to estimate the percentage of novel variants likely to be deleterious. At optimal cut-off values, which had 69-98% sensitivity in detecting GT mutations, between 27% and 71% of the novel αIIb or β3 missense variants were predicted to be deleterious.

10727448,"Genetic factors are believed to influence the development of arterial thromboses. Because integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) plays a crucial role in thrombus formation, we analyzed receptor adhesive properties using Chinese hamster ovary and human kidney embryonal 293 cells overexpressing the Pl(A1) or Pl(A2) polymorphic forms of alpha(IIb)beta(3). Soluble fibrinogen binding was no different between Pl(A1) and Pl(A2) cells, either in a resting state or when alpha(IIb)beta(3) was activated with anti-LIBS6. Pl(A1) and Pl(A2) cells bound equivalently to immobilized fibronectin. In contrast, significantly more Pl(A2) cells bound to immobilized fibrinogen in an alpha(IIb)beta(3)-dependent manner than did Pl(A1) cells. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D abolished the increased binding of Pl(A2) cells. Compared with Pl(A1) cells, Pl(A2) cells exhibited a greater extent of polymerized actin and cell spreading, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), and greater fibrin clot retraction. These adhesion differences appear to depend on a signaling mechanism sensitive to receptor occupancy.

26115329,"The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a Ca2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle and is mutated in several diseases, including malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD). Most MH and CCD mutations cause accelerated Ca2+ release, resulting in abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle. However, how specific mutations affect the channel to produce different phenotypes is not well understood. In this study, we have investigated 11 mutations at 7 different positions in the amino (N)-terminal region of RyR1 (9 MH and 2 MH/CCD mutations) using a heterologous expression system in HEK293 cells. In live-cell Ca2+ imaging at room temperature (~25 °C), cells expressing mutant channels exhibited alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, i.e., an enhanced sensitivity to caffeine, a depletion of Ca2+ in the ER and an increase in resting cytoplasmic Ca2+. RyR1 channel activity was quantitatively evaluated by [3H]ryanodine binding and three parameters (sensitivity to activating Ca2+, sensitivity to inactivating Ca2+ and attainable maximum activity, i.e., gain) were obtained by fitting analysis. The mutations increased the gain and the sensitivity to activating Ca2+ in a site-specific manner. The gain was consistently higher in both MH and MH/CCD mutations. Sensitivity to activating Ca2+ was markedly enhanced in MH/CCD mutations. The channel activity estimated from the three parameters provides a reasonable explanation to the pathological phenotype assessed by Ca2+ homeostasis. These properties were also observed at higher temperatures (~37 °C). Our data suggest that divergent activity profiles may cause varied disease phenotypes by specific mutations.

31607937,"Mice (Y522S or YS), carrying a mutation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle fibers (ryanodine receptor type-1, RyR1) which causes Ca2+ leak, are a widely accepted and intensively studied model for human malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. Since the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of mitochondria in MH crisis has been previously debated, here we sought to determine Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria and its possible link with ROS production in single fibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) of YS mice. We found that Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, as detected with the ratiometric FRET-based 4mtD3cpv probe, was higher in YS than in wild-type (WT) fibers at rest and after Ca2+ release from SR during repetitive electrical stimulation or caffeine administration. Also mitochondrial ROS production associated with contractile activity (detected with Mitosox probe) was much higher in YS fibers than in WT. Importantly, the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake achieved by silencing MCU reduced ROS accumulation in the matrix and Ca2+ release from SR. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS accumulation using Mitotempo reduced SR Ca2+ release in YS fibers exposed to caffeine. The present results support the view that mitochondria take up larger amounts of Ca2+ in YS than in WT fibers and that mitochondrial ROS production substantially contributes to the increased caffeine-sensitivity and to the enhanced Ca2+ release from SR in YS fibers.",PS3,NM_000540.3:c.1565A>C,"Functional studies in HEK293 cells show increased sensitivity to RYR1 agonists.

9334205,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) are autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal muscle in which a potentially fatal hypermetabolic crisis can be triggered by commonly used anesthetic agents. To date, 17 mutations in the human RYR1 gene encoding the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (the ryanodine receptor) have been associated with MH and/or CCD. Although many of these mutations have been linked to MH and/or CCD, with high lod (log of the odds favoring linkage versus nonlinkage) scores, others have been found in single, small families. Independent biochemical evidence for a causal role for these mutations in MH is available for only two mutants. Mutations corresponding to the human MH mutations were made in a full-length rabbit RYR1 cDNA, and wild type and mutant cDNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells. After about 48 h, intact cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, and intracellular Ca2+ release, induced by caffeine or halothane, was measured by photometry. Ca2+ release in cells expressing MH or CCD mutant ryanodine receptors was invariably significantly more sensitive to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane than Ca2+ release in cells expressing wild type receptors or receptors mutated in other regions of the molecule. Linear regression analysis showed that there is a strong correlation (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) between caffeine sensitivity of different RYR1 mutants measured by the cellular Ca2+ photometry assay and by the clinical in vitro caffeine halothane contracture test (IVCT). The correlation was weaker, however, for halothane (r = 0.49, p > 0.05). Abnormal sensitivity in the Ca2+ photometry assay provides supporting evidence for a causal role in MH for each of 15 single amino acid mutations in the ryanodine receptor. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the cellular Ca2+ photometry assay in the assessment of the sensitivity to caffeine and halothane of specific ryanodine receptor mutants.",PS3,NM_000540.3:c.1565A>C,"Functional studies in HEK293 cells show increased sensitivity to RYR1 agonists.

Mutations in the RYR1 gene cause severe muscle diseases such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is a disorder of CICR via RYR1. Thus far, >300 mutations in RYR1 have been reported in patients with MH. However, owing to a lack of comprehensive analysis of the structure-function relationship of mutant RYR1, the mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we combined functional studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RYR1 bearing disease-associated mutations at the N-terminal region. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the mutant RYR1 caused abnormalities in Ca2+ homeostasis. MD simulations of WT and mutant RYR1s were performed using crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) monomer, consisting of A, B, and C domains. We found that the mutations located around the interdomain region differentially affected hydrogen bonds/salt bridges. Particularly, mutations at R402, which increase the open probability of the channel, cause clockwise rotation of BC domains with respect to the A domain by alteration of the interdomain interactions. Similar results were also obtained with artificial mutations that mimic alteration of the interactions. Our results reveal the importance of interdomain interactions within the NTD in the regulation of the RYR1 channel and provide insights into the mechanism of MH caused by the mutations at the NTD.",PS3_moderate,NM_000540.2:c.1202G>A,Functional studies in HEK293 cells show an increased sensitivity to RYR1 agonists,,1,"Gene: RYR1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_38451843_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_38942483_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.38451843G>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.38942483G>A, rsID: rs193922766, HGVSc: c.1202G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg401His, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R401H"

Cells expressing homotetrameric CCD or MH mutant RyR1 exhibited lower maximal peak amplitudes of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release than cells expressing wild type RyR1, suggesting that MH and CCD mutants might be ""leaky."" In cells expressing homotetrameric wild type or mutant RyR1, the amplitude of 10 mM caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was correlated significantly with the amplitude of carbachol- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release, indicating that maximal drug-induced Ca2+ release depends on the size of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. The content of endogenous sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2b (SERCA2b), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 45Ca2+ uptake, and confocal microscopy, was increased in HEK-293 cells expressing wild type or mutant RyR1, supporting the view that endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage capacity is increased as a compensatory response to an enhanced Ca2+ leak. When heterotetrameric (1:1) combinations of MH/CCD mutant and wild type RyR1 were expressed together with SERCA1 to enhance Ca2+ reuptake, the amplitude of Ca2+ release in response to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane was higher than that observed in cells expressing wild type RyR1 and SERCA1.

31843900,"Mutations responsible for inherited disease may act by disrupting normal transcriptional splicing. Such mutations can be difficult to detect, and their effects difficult to characterize, because many lie deep within exons or introns where they may alter splice enhancers or silencers or introduce new splice acceptors or donors. Multiple mutation-specific and genome-wide approaches have been developed to evaluate these classes of mutations. We introduce a complementary experimental approach, cBROCA, which yields qualitative and quantitative assessments of the effects of genomic mutations on transcriptional splicing of tumor suppressor genes. cBROCA analysis is undertaken by deriving complementary DNA (cDNA) from puromycin-treated patient lymphoblasts, hybridizing the cDNA to the BROCA panel of tumor suppressor genes, and then multiplex sequencing to very high coverage. At each splice junction suggested by split sequencing reads, read depths of test and control samples are compared. Significant Z scores indicate altered transcripts, over and above naturally occurring minor transcripts, and comparisons of read depths indicate relative abundances of mutant and normal transcripts. BROCA analysis of genomic DNA suggested 120 rare mutations from 150 families with cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus, or colon, in >600 informative genotyped relatives. cBROCA analysis of their transcripts revealed a wide variety of consequences of abnormal splicing in tumor suppressor genes, including whole or partial exon skipping, exonification of intronic sequence, loss or gain of exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers, complete intron retention, hypomorphic alleles, and combinations of these alterations.

Frequently mutations resulting in depletion of ETHE1 in patient cells are due to severe structural and folding defects. However, some ETHE1 mutations yield nearly normal protein levels and in these cases disease mechanism was suspected to lie in compromised catalytic activity. To address this issue and to elicit how ETHE1 dysfunction results in EE, we have investigated two such pathological mutations, ETHE1-p.Arg163Gln and p.Arg163Trp. In addition, we report a number of benchmark properties of wild type human ETHE1, including for the first time the redox properties of the mononuclear iron centre.

ETHE1 wild type and variants bind 1 ± 0.2 mol iron/protein and no zinc; however, the variants exhibited only ≈ 10% of wild-type catalytically activity.

25584008,"PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pediatric malignancy. It occurs in excess among individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which results primarily from germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Prior series exploring frequencies of germline TP53 mutation among children with ACC have been small, geographically limited, or subject to referral bias. The functional consequence of mutations has not been related to phenotype. We provide a genotype-phenotype analysis of TP53 mutations in pediatric ACC and propose a model for tissue-specific effects based on adrenocortical ontogeny.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive, unrelated children with ACC, unselected for family history, underwent germline TP53 sequencing. Rate and distribution of mutations were identified. Functional analysis was performed for novel TP53 variants. Correlation with the International Agency for Research on Cancer p53 database further delineated mutational distribution, association with family history, and risk for multiple primary malignancies (MPMs).
RESULTS: Germline mutations were present in 50% of children. These mutations did not correspond to the conventional hotspot mutations. There was a wide range of mutant protein function. Patients bearing alleles encoding protein with higher functionality were less likely to have a strong family cancer history, whereas those with greater loss of function had MPMs and/or positive family history.

The genetic basis of FH is most commonly mutations within the LDLR gene. Assessing the pathogenicity of LDLR variants is particularly important to give a patient a definitive diagnosis of FH. Current studies of LDLR activity ex vivo are based on the analysis of 125I-labeled lipoproteins (reference method) or fluorescent-labelled LDL. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of these two methods to assess LDLR functionality in order to validate a functional assay to analyse LDLR mutations. LDLR activity of different variants has been studied by flow cytometry using FITC-labelled LDL and compared with studies performed previously with 125I-labeled lipoproteins. Flow cytometry results are in full agreement with the data obtained by the 125I methodology. Additionally confocal microscopy allowed the assignment of different class mutation to the variants assayed. Use of fluorescence yielded similar results than 125I-labeled lipoproteins concerning LDLR activity determination, and also allows class mutation classification.

12522687,"Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in plasma generally reflect complex influences of multiple genetic loci. Even an autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity, as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels vary widely within the same pedigree. Molecular screening for LDL receptor ( LDLR) mutations among 75 patients with clinically apparent FH led to identification of a novel splice-site mutation (IVS14+1 G>A) shared by 14 patients. Genealogical research confirmed that all 14 carriers were part of the same 1135-member pedigree with a common ancestor. The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein, reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele. Of the 208 members of the kindred who were screened for the presence of this LDLR mutation, we identified 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers. Nine principal apolipoprotein genes that might affect LDL cholesterol differentially according to LDL-receptor status were examined in this pedigree. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values were observed among the majority of the LDLR mutation carriers who were simultaneously homozygous for the -265C variant of apoA-II (total cholesterol: 324 +/- 8 vs 244 +/- 19 mg/dl, P = 0.0015; LDL-cholesterol: 237 +/- 8 vs 155 +/- 18 mg/dl, P = 0.0008). In vitro transfection assays showed that transcriptional activity of the apoA-II promoter was reduced by 30% in the -265C variant as compared with the -265T variant.

In selected populations such as the Afrikaners in South Africa, the Christian Lebanese, and the French Canadians, the disease is more frequent due to the founder effect. Previous studies demonstrated that a single mutation at the LDL receptor locus, the so-called French Canadian deletion, makes up 60% of the mutant genes responsible for FH in the French Canadian population. In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as well as two deletions.

Approximately 50% of the LDLR mutations are defined as class 2 mutations, with the mutant proteins partially or entirely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine the degradation pathway of the LDLR class 2 mutants, we examined the effects of inhibition of several potential pathways on the levels of the wild-type LDLR and its four representative class 2 mutants (S156L, C176Y, E207K, and C646Y) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin blocked the degradation of the LDLR mutants, but not that of the wild-type LDLR. Treatment of CHO cells with these proteasome inhibitors led to a significant accumulation of the mutants at steady state. Furthermore, cell surface levels of the LDLR mutants were significantly increased upon inhibition of the proteasome degradation pathway. In contrast to the proteasome inhibitors, inhibitors of trypsin-like proteases, chymotrypsin-like proteases, and lysosomal pathway inhibitors did not affect the levels of the LDLR mutants.

10906332,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is responsible for removing the majority of the LDL cholesterol from the plasma. Mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause the disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Approximately 50% of the mutations in the LDL receptor gene in patients with FH lead to receptor proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Misfolding of mutant LDL receptors is a probable cause of this ER retention, resulting in no functional LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, the specific factors and mechanisms responsible for retention of mutant LDL receptors are unknown. In the present study we show that the molecular chaperone Grp78/BiP co-immunoprecipitates with both the wild type and two different mutant (W556S and C646Y) LDL receptors in lysates obtained from human liver cells overexpressing wild type or mutant LDL receptors. A pulse-chase study shows that the interaction between the wild type LDL receptor and Grp78 is no longer detectable after 2(1/2) h, whereas it persists for more than 4 h with the mutant receptors. Furthermore, about five times more Grp78 is co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptors than with the wild type receptor suggesting that Grp78 is involved in retention of mutant LDL receptors in the ER. Overexpression of Grp78 causes no major alterations on the steady state level of active LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, overexpression of Grp78 decreases the processing rate of newly synthesized wild type LDL receptors. This indicates that the Grp78 interaction is a rate-limiting step in the maturation of the wild type LDL receptor and that Grp78 may be an important factor in the quality control of newly synthesized LDL receptors.",PS3_moderate,NM_000527.5:c.2000G>A,"Level 2 assay - study on hmz patient's fibroblasts, after 2 hours pulse-chase, only 20% of receptors were processed to the mature form.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels and an extremely high risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A phase 2, proof-of-concept study (NCT02265952) demonstrated that evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3 protein), reduced LDL-C levels in 9 patients with genotypically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well tolerated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of evinacumab on LDLR activity in lymphocytes purified from patients in the proof-of-concept study. Approach and Results: LDLR activity was assessed in patient lymphocytes before and after treatment with evinacumab and versus lymphocytes carrying wild-type LDLR, and also in an LDLR-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-ldlA7) transfected with plasmids encoding the LDLR variants. Overall mean peak reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab was -58±18%, occurring between Week 4 and Week 12. Mutations identified in the 9 patients were shown to be pathogenic, with loss of LDLR activity versus wild type. Two of the LDLR variants, p.(Cys681*) and p.(Ala627Profs*38), were class 2 type mutations that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six variants were class 3 type mutations with impaired LDL-C binding activity: p.(Trp87Gly), occurring in 2 patients, p.(Gln254Pro), p.(Ser177Leu), p.(Gly335Val), and p.(Ser306Leu). Evinacumab had no effect on LDLR activity.

8282784,"We studied the defect responsible for Glanzmann thrombasthenia in a patient whose platelets expressed < 5% of the normal amount of GPIIb-IIIa. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that the patient's GPIIIa genes were normal. However, DNA analysis revealed the patient homozygous for a G818-->A substitution in her GPIIb genes, resulting in a Gly273-->Asp substitution adjacent to the first GPIIb calcium-binding domain. To determine how this mutation impaired GPIIb-IIIa expression, recombinant GPIIb containing the mutation was coexpressed with GPIIIa in COS-1 cells. The GPIIb mutant formed stable GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers that were not immunoprecipitated by either of two heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the mutation disrupted the epitopes for these antibodies. Moreover, the GPIIb in the heterodimers was not cleaved into heavy and light chains, indicating that the heterodimers were not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex where GPIIb cleavage occurs, nor were the mutant heterodimers expressed on the cell surface. These studies demonstrate that a Gly273-->Asp mutation in GPIIb does not prevent the assembly of GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers, but alters the conformation of these heterodimers sufficiently to impair their intracellular transport.

27857962,"Malignant hyperthermia manifests as a rapid and sustained rise in temperature in response to pharmacological triggering agents, e.g. inhalational anesthetics and the muscle relaxant suxamethonium. Other clinical signs include an increase in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption, as well as tachycardia, and if untreated a malignant hyperthermia episode can result in death. The metabolic changes are caused by dysregulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis, resulting from a defective ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel, which resides in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and controls the flux of Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores to the cytoplasm. Most genetic variants associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia occur in the RYR1 gene encoding the ryanodine receptor type 1. While malignant hyperthermia susceptibility can be diagnosed by in vitro contracture testing of skeletal muscle biopsy tissue, it is advantageous to use DNA testing. Currently only 35 of over 400 potential variants in RYR1 have been classed as functionally causative of malignant hyperthermia and thus can be used for DNA diagnostic tests. Here we describe functional analysis of 2 RYR1 variants (c. 7042_7044delCAG, p.ΔGlu2348 and c.641C&gt;T, p.Thr214Met) that occur in the same malignant hyperthermia susceptible family. The p.Glu2348 deletion, causes hypersensitivity to ryanodine receptor agonists using in vitro analysis of cloned human RYR1 cDNA expressed in HEK293T cells, while the Thr214Met substitution, does not appear to significantly alter sensitivity to agonist in the same system.

36208971,"BACKGROUND: A major bottleneck to the introduction of noninvasive presymptomatic diagnostic tests for the pharmacogenetic disorder malignant hyperthermia is the lack of functional data for associated variants.
METHODS: We screened 50 genes having a potential role in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis using the HaloPlex™ (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) target enrichment system and next-generation sequencing. Twenty-one patients with a history of a clinical malignant hyperthermia reaction together with a positive in vitro contracture test were included. Eight variants in RYR1 were subsequently introduced into the cDNA for the human ryanodine receptor gene and tested in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells for their effect on calcium release from intracellular stores in response to the ryanodine receptor-1 agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol using fura-2 as calcium indicator. Each variant was subjected to in silico curation using the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group scoring matrix and ClinGen RYR1 variant curation expert panel guidelines.
RESULTS: Potentially causative RYR1 variants were identified in 15 patients. Of these, two families carried two RYR1 variants, five variants had been previously reported as 'pathogenic', two variants had been previously reported as 'likely benign', and eight were of 'uncertain significance'. Of these eight variants, four showed hypersensitivity to 4-chloro-m-cresol. Three variants were reclassified as either 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic'. Two were classified as 'benign', whilst three remained of 'uncertain significance'.
CONCLUSIONS: Three (p.Tyr1711Cys, p.Val2280Ile, and p.Arg4737Gln) additional variants can be added to the list of RYR1 disease-associated variants managed by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group. These can therefore be used diagnostically in the future.

33490280,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the potential safety of remimazolam and propofol in malignant hyperthermia- (HM-) susceptible patients using ryanodine receptor 1- (RYR1-) expressing human embryonic kidney- (HEK-) 293 cells.
METHODS: We compared the enhanced responsiveness of HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type RYR1 with that of mutant RYR1 to caffeine following perfusion with remimazolam or propofol. Furthermore, we investigated whether RYR1 enhanced the responsiveness of cells to remimazolam or propofol and compared the median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>; i.e., the concentration required to reach half-maximal activation) using an unpaired two-tailed t-test while a P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Remimazolam and propofol did not promote the caffeine-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in HEK-293 cells expressing mutant RYR1 even with exposure to approximately 100-fold the clinically used concentration. In wild-type RYR1, EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam following refusion vs. nonperfusion were 2.86 mM vs. 2.75 mM (P = 0.76) while for propofol perfusion vs. nonperfusion, they were 2.76 mM vs. 2.75 mM, respectively (P = 0.83). In mutant RYR1, EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam refusion vs. nonperfusion were 1.58 mM vs. 1.71 mM, respectively (P = 0.63) while for propofol perfusion vs. nonperfusion, they were 1.65 mM vs. 1.71 mM, respectively (P = 0.73). Remimazolam and propofol increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in a concentration-dependent manner, but the effect was not enhanced by RYR1. EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam with non-RYR1 vs. wild-type RYR1 were 1.00 mM vs. 0.92 mM, respectively (P = 0.91) while those of propofol were 1.09 mM vs. 1.05 mM, respectively (P = 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused by remimazolam or propofol was not considered an RYR1-mediated reaction.

8094613,"Glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII) is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). This paper reports on the analysis of the mutant alleles in an American black patient with an adult form of GSDII (GM1935). The lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor of this patient has abnormal molecular features: (i) the molecular mass is decreased, (ii) the phosphorylation is deficient and (iii) the proteolytic processing is impaired. Sequence analysis revealed four mutations leading to amino acid alterations: Asp-645-->Glu, Val-816-->Ile, Arg-854-->Stop and Thr-927-->Ile. By using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on PCR-amplified cDNA we have demonstrated that the Arg-854-->Stop mutation is located in one allele that is not expressed, and that the other allele contains the remaining three mutations. Each of the mutations was introduced in wild-type cDNA and expressed in COS cells to analyse the effect on biosynthesis, transport and phosphorylation of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. The Val-816-->Ile substitution appeared to have no significant effect in contrast with results [Martiniuk, Mehler, Bodkin, Tzall, Hirshhorn, Zhong and Hirschhorn (1991) DNA Cell Biol. 10, 681-687] and was therefore defined as a polymorphism. The Thr-927-->Ile substitution deleting one of the seven glycosylation sites was found to be responsible for the decrease in molecular-mass, but not for the deficient proteolytic processing and phosphorylation. It did not cause the enzyme deficiency either.

19875463,"Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunit 6 of ATPase (ATP6) are associated with variable disease expression, ranging from adult onset neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) to fatal childhood maternally inherited Leigh's syndrome (MILS). Phenotypical variations have largely been attributed to mtDNA heteroplasmy. However, there is often a discrepancy between the levels of mutant mtDNA and disease severity. Therefore, the correlation among genetic defect, bioenergetic impairment and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS remains to be elucidated. We investigated the bioenergetics of cybrids from five patients carrying different ATP6 mutations: three harboring the T8993G, one with the T8993C and one with the T9176G mutation. The bioenergetic defects varied dramatically, not only among different ATP6 mutants, but also among lines carrying the same T8993G mutation. Mutants with the most severe ATP synthesis impairment showed defective respiration and disassembly of respiratory chain complexes. This indicates that respiratory chain defects modulate the bioenergetic impairment in NARP/MILS cells. Sequencing of the entire mtDNA from the different mutant cell lines identified variations in structural genes, resulting in amino acid changes that destabilize the respiratory chain. Taken together, these results indicate that the mtDNA background plays an important role in modulating the biochemical defects and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS.",PS3_supporting,NC_012920.1:m.8993T>G,Cybrid studies supported the functional impact of this variant,,1,"Gene: , chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chrM_8993_T_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chrM_8994_T_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.N/A, HGVSg (hg37): g.N/A, rsID: N/A, HGVSc: N/A, HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"

29985963,"Lymphatic malformations (LM) are characterized by the overgrowth of lymphatic vessels during pre- and postnatal development. Macrocystic, microcystic and combined forms of LM are known. The cysts are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Resection and sclerotherapy are the most common treatment methods. Recent studies performed on LM specimens in the United States of America have identified activating mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene in LM. However, whole tissue but not isolated cell types were studied. Here, we studied LM tissues resected at the University Hospitals Freiburg and Regensburg, Germany. We isolated LECs and fibroblasts separately, and sequenced the commonly affected exons 8, 10, and 21 of the PIK3CA gene. We confirm typical monoallelic mutations in 4 out of 6 LM-derived LEC lines, and describe two new mutations i.) in exon 10 (c.1636C>A; p.Gln546Lys), and ii.) a 3bp in-frame deletion of GAA (Glu109del). LM-derived fibroblasts did not possess such mutations, showing cell-type specificity of the gene defect.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the underlying molecular cause of FCD, hemimegalencephaly, and diffuse megalencephaly.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with FCD, hemimegalencephaly, or megalencephaly (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 2-32 years) were recruited from Pediatric Hospital A. Meyer, the University of Hong Kong, and Seattle Children's Research Institute from June 2012 to June 2014. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 8 children with FCD or hemimegalencephaly using standard-depth (50-60X) sequencing in peripheral samples (blood, saliva, or skin) from the affected child and their parents and deep (150-180X) sequencing in affected brain tissue. Targeted sequencing and WES were used to screen 93 children with molecularly unexplained diffuse or focal brain overgrowth. Histopathologic and functional assays of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (serine/threonine kinase)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activity in resected brain tissue and cultured neurons were performed to validate mutations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing identified variants associated with this spectrum of developmental brain disorders.
RESULTS: Low-level mosaic mutations of MTOR were identified in brain tissue in 4 children with FCD type 2a with alternative allele fractions ranging from 0.012 to 0.086. Intermediate-level mosaic mutation of MTOR (p.Thr1977Ile) was also identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and pigmentary mosaicism in skin. Finally, a constitutional de novo mutation of MTOR (p.Glu1799Lys) was identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and intellectual disability. Molecular and functional analysis in 2 children with FCD2a from whom multiple affected brain tissue samples were available revealed a mutation gradient with an epicenter in the most epileptogenic area. When expressed in cultured neurons, all MTOR mutations identified here drive constitutive activation of mTOR complex 1 and enlarged neuronal size.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, mutations of MTOR were associated with a spectrum of brain overgrowth phenotypes extending from FCD type 2a to diffuse megalencephaly, distinguished by different mutations and levels of mosaicism.

Here we describe a mutation assessment pipeline enabled by high-throughput engineering of molecularly barcoded gene variant expression clones identified by tumor sequencing. We first used this platform to functionally assess tail mutations observed in PIK3CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) frequently mutated in cancer. Orthogonal screening for PIK3CA variant activity using in vitro and in vivo cell growth and transformation assays differentiated driver from passenger mutations, revealing that PIK3CA variant activity correlates imperfectly with its mutation frequency across breast cancer populations. Although PIK3CA mutations with frequencies above 5% were significantly more oncogenic than wild-type in all assays, mutations occurring at 0.07% to 5.0% included those with and without oncogenic activities that ranged from weak to strong in at least one assay. Proteomic profiling coupled with therapeutic sensitivity assays on PIK3CA variant-expressing cell models revealed variant-specific activation of PI3K signaling as well as other pathways that include the MEK1/2 module of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

In a variety of cancer cells, overactivation of mTOR has been reported. In addition, mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its derivatives, are being evaluated in clinical trials as anticancer drugs. However, no active mutants of mTOR have been identified in human cancer. Here, we report that two different point mutations, S2215Y and R2505P, identified in human cancer genome database confer constitutive activation of mTOR signaling even under nutrient starvation conditions. S2215Y was identified in large intestine adenocarcinoma whereas R2505P was identified in renal cell carcinoma. mTOR complex 1 prepared from cells expressing the mutant mTOR after nutrient starvation still retains the activity to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vitro. The cells expressing the mTOR mutant show increased percentage of S-phase cells and exhibit resistance to cell size decrease by amino-acid starvation. The activated mutants are still sensitive to rapamycin. However, they show increased resistance to 1-butanol.

However, the pathophysiological significance of its activity is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the leucine sensor function for mTORC1 activation of LRS can be decoupled from its catalytic activity. We identified compounds that inhibit the leucine-dependent mTORC1 pathway by specifically inhibiting the GTPase activating function of LRS, while not affecting the catalytic activity. For further analysis, we selected one compound, BC-LI-0186, which binds to the RagD interacting site of LRS, thereby inhibiting lysosomal localization of LRS and mTORC1 activity. It also effectively suppressed the activity of cancer-associated MTOR mutants and the growth of rapamycin-resistant cancer cells. These findings suggest new strategies for controlling tumor growth that avoid the resistance to existing mTOR inhibitors resulting from cancer-associated MTOR mutations.Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS) is a leucine sensor of the mTORC1 pathway.

However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to cortical dyslamination remains poorly understood. Here, using patient tissue, genome-edited cells, and mouse models with brain somatic mutations in MTOR, we discovered that disruption of neuronal ciliogenesis by the mutations underlies cortical dyslamination in FMCDs. We found that abnormal accumulation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites due to perturbed autophagy was responsible for the defective neuronal ciliogenesis.

10585442,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is an atypical dimeric homeodomain-containing protein that is expressed in liver, intestine, stomach, kidney, and pancreas. Mutations in the HNF1alpha gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). More than 80 different mutations have been identified so far, many of which involve highly conserved amino acid residues among vertebrate HNF1alpha. In the present work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which MODY3 mutations could affect HNF1alpha function. For this purpose, we analyzed the properties of 10 mutants resulting in amino acid substitutions or protein truncation. Some mutants have a reduced protein stability, whereas others are either defective in the DNA binding or impaired in their intrinsic trans-activation potential. Three mutants, characterized by a complete loss of trans-activation, behave as dominant negatives when transfected with the wild-type protein. These data define a clear causative relationship between MODY3 mutations and functional defects in HNF1alpha trans-activation.

12488960,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the gene encoding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, HNF1 alpha. In this study we have examined the in vivo and in vitro effects of a mutation (L107I) outside the DNA binding and dimerization domains in the N terminal part of the HNF1 alpha gene.
METHODS: Beta-cell function of the affected family members was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Functional tests were carried out to explain the role of the mutation in vitro by transcriptional activity assay, Western blotting, DNA-binding assays and subcellular localization experiments.
RESULTS: Affected family members showed an 86% decreased insulin response to glucose when compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. In vitro the mutation showed a 79% decrease in transcriptional activity as compared to wild type HNF1 alpha in HeLa cells lacking HNF1 alpha. The transcriptional activity was not suppressed when the mutant was co-expressed with wild type HNF1 alpha suggesting that the decreased activity was not mediated by a dominant negative mechanism. The L107I/HNF1alpha protein showed normal nuclear targeting but impaired binding to an HNF1 alpha consensus sequence.

METHODS: We screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in 50 unrelated southern Chinese families, which fulfilled the minimum criteria for MODY. Functional properties of the mutant proteins were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: Five of the 50 (10%) families were found to have mutations in the coding region, including a new nonsense mutation Q176X and four reported mutations (frameshift mutation P379fsdelCT, nonsense mutation R171X, missense mutations G20R and P112L). These mutations had decreased trans-activating activity on the human insulin gene promoter. We also detected a new intronic sequence variation IVS7nt-6 G-->A, which co-segregated with diabetes.

A correct diagnosis matters as it informs on treatment, progression, and family risk. We describe a multi-dimensional functional dataset of 73 HNF1A missense variants identified in exomes of 12,940 individuals. Our aim was to develop an analytical framework for stratifying variants along the HNF1A phenotypic continuum to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. HNF1A variant function was determined by four different molecular assays. Structure of the multi-dimensional dataset was explored using principal component analysis, k-means, and hierarchical clustering. Weights for tissue-specific isoform expression and functional domain were integrated. Functionally annotated variant subgroups were used to re-evaluate genetic diagnoses in national MODY diagnostic registries. HNF1A variants demonstrated a range of behaviors across the assays. The structure of the multi-parametric data was shaped primarily by transactivation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we obtained high-resolution functional clusters of the variants that separated known causal MODY variants from benign and type 2 diabetes risk variants and led to reclassification of 4% and 9% of HNF1A variants identified in the UK and Norway MODY diagnostic registries, respectively.

12530534,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha is a homeo-domain-containing transcription factor participating in the regulation of gene expression in liver, kidney, gut and pancreas of vertebrates. In humans mutations in the HNF1 gene are responsible for one form of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). To define the molecular mechanism underlying MODY3 we investigated the functional properties of seven MODY3-associated mutations representing the spectrum of different kinds of mutations affecting all functional domains of the protein. The mutations introduced into an expression vector encoding human HNF1alpha include in-frame deletion (AN127), nonsense (Q7X, R171X), frameshift (P291fsinsC) and missense (R229Q, P447L, T6201) mutations. Gel retardation and reporter gene assays showed that the functional properties of these mutants differ dramatically, but none of these mutants act in a dominant negative manner.

17293538,"A novel single-nucleotide deletion in exon 100 of the RYR1 gene, corresponding to deletion of nucleotide 14,510 in the human RyR1 mRNA (c14510delA), was identified in a man with malignant hyperthermia and in his two daughters who were normal for malignant hyperthermia. This deletion results in a RyR1 protein lacking the last 202 amino acid residues. All three subjects heterozygotic for the mutated allele presented with a prevalence of type 1 fibres with central cores, although none experienced clinical signs of myopathy. Expression of the truncated protein resulted in non-functional RYR1 calcium release channels. Expression of wild-type and RyR1(R4836fsX4838) proteins resulted in heterozygotic release channels with overall functional properties similar to those of wild-type RyR1 channels. Nevertheless, small differences in sensitivity to calcium and caffeine were observed in heterotetrameric channels, which also presented an altered assembly/stability in sucrose-gradient centrifugation analysis. Altogether, these data suggest that altered RYR1 tetramer assembly/stability coupled with subtle chronic changes in Ca2+ homoeostasis over the long term may contribute to the development of core lesions and incomplete malignant hyperthermia susceptibility penetrance in individuals carrying this novel RYR1 mutation.",BS3_supporting,NM_000540.2:c.14510del,,"Experiments expressing this variant in HEK293 cells did not demonstrate NMD as determined by protein expression on a Western blot.

28403410,"BACKGROUND: . Missense variants in the ryanodine receptor 1 gene ( RYR1 ) are associated with malignant hyperthermia but only a minority of these have met the criteria for use in predictive DNA diagnosis. We examined the utility of a simplified method of segregation analysis and a functional assay for determining the pathogenicity of recurrent RYR1 variants associated with malignant hyperthermia.
METHODS: . We identified previously uncharacterised RYR1 variants found in four or more malignant hyperthermia families and conducted simplified segregation analyses. An efficient cloning and mutagenesis strategy was used to express ryanodine receptor protein containing one of six RYR1 variants in HEK293 cells. Caffeine-induced calcium release, measured using a fluorescent calcium indicator, was compared in cells expressing each variant to that in cells expressing wild type ryanodine receptor protein.
RESULTS.: We identified 43 malignant hyperthermia families carrying one of the six RYR1 variants. There was segregation of genotype with the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility phenotype in families carrying the p.E3104K and p.D3986E variants, but the number of informative meioses limited the statistical significance of the associations. HEK293 functional assays demonstrated an increased sensitivity of RyR1 channels containing the p.R2336H, p.R2355W, p.E3104K, p.G3990V and p.V4849I compared with wild type, but cells expressing p.D3986E had a similar caffeine sensitivity to cells expressing wild type RyR1.
CONCLUSIONS: . Segregation analysis is of limited value in assessing pathogenicity of RYR1 variants in malignant hyperthermia.

Our aim was to define the prevalence and role of variants in the three genes implicated in MH susceptibility in the largest comprehensively phenotyped MH cohort worldwide.
METHODS: We initially included one individual from each positive family tested in the UK MH Unit since 1971 to detect variants in RYR1, CACNA1S, or STAC3. Screening for genetic variants has been ongoing since 1991 and has involved a range of techniques, most recently next generation sequencing. We assessed the pathogenicity of variants using standard guidelines, including family segregation studies. The prevalence of recurrent variants of unknown significance was compared with the prevalence reported in a large database of sequence variants in low-risk populations.
RESULTS: We have confirmed MH susceptibility in 795 independent families, for 722 of which we have a DNA sample. Potentially pathogenic variants were found in 555 families, with 25 RYR1 and one CACNA1S variants previously unclassified recurrent variants significantly over-represented (P&lt;1×10-7) in our cohort compared with the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. There was genotype-phenotype discordance in 86 of 328 families suitable for segregation analysis. We estimate non-RYR1/CACNA1S/STAC3 susceptibility occurs in 14-23% of MH families.

12732639,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that segregates with >60 mutations within the MHS-1 locus on chromosome 19 coding for ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). Although some MHRyR1s have been shown to enhance sensitivity to caffeine and halothane when expressed in non-muscle cells, their influence on EC coupling can only be studied in skeletal myotubes. We therefore expressed WTRyR1, six of the most common human MHRyR1s (R163C, G341R, R614C, R2163C, V2168M, and R2458H), and a newly identified C-terminal mutation (T4826I) in dyspedic myotubes to study their functional defects and how they influence EC coupling. Myotubes expressing any MHRyR1 were significantly more sensitive to stimulation by caffeine and 4-CmC than those expressing WTRyR1. The hypersensitivity of MH myotubes extended to K+ depolarization. MH myotubes responded to direct channel activators with maximum Ca2+ amplitudes consistently smaller than WT myotubes, whereas the amplitude of their responses to depolarization were consistently larger than WT myotubes. The magnitudes of responses attainable from myotubes expressing MHRyR1s are therefore related to the nature of the stimulus rather than size of the Ca2+ store. The functional changes of MHRyR1s were directly analyzed using [3H]ryanodine binding analysis of isolated myotube membranes. Although none of the MHRyR1s examined significantly altered EC50 for Ca2+ activation, many failed to be completely inhibited by a low Ca2+ (<or=100 nm), and all were significantly more responsive to caffeine than WTRyR1 at Ca2+ concentrations that approximate those in resting myotubes. All seven mutations had diminished sensitivity to inhibition by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Using a homologous expression system, our study demonstrates for the first time that these 7 MH mutations are all both necessary and sufficient to induce MH-related phenotypes. Decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ and Mg2+ inhibition and inability of MHRyR1s to be fully inactivated at [Ca2+]i typical of normal myotubes at rest are key defects that contribute to the initiation of MH episodes.",PS3_Moderate,NM_000540.3:c.7373G>A,Functional studies in HEK293 cells and dyspedic myotubes show an increased sensitivity to RYR1 agonists,,1,"Gene: RYR1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_38500655_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_38991295_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.38500655G>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.38991295G>A, rsID: rs121918594, HGVSc: c.7373G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg2458His, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R2458H"

However, the pathogenesis of glaucoma induced by MYOC mutations has not been fully clarified. Here, we analyze the molecular and cellular biological differences caused by multiple variant myocilins, including protein secretion characteristics, structural changes, subcellular localization, cellular autophagic activity and oxidative stress. Denaturing and nondenaturing electrophoresis showed myocilin to be a secreted protein with the tendency to self-oligomerize. The full-length myocilin and its C-terminal cleavage fragment are secreted. Secretion analysis of 23 variant myocilins indicated that secretion defects are closely related to the pathogenicity of MYOC variants. Structural analysis showed that the alteration of steric clash is associated with the secretion characteristics and pathogenicity of myocilin variants. Immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that mutated myocilins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and disrupt autophagy.

21612213,"Myocilin variants, localized to the olfactomedin (OLF) domain, are linked to early-onset, inherited forms of open-angle glaucoma. Disease-causing myocilin variants accumulate within trabecular meshwork cells instead of being secreted to the trabecular extracellular matrix of the eye. We hypothesize that, like in other diseases of protein misfolding, aggregation and downstream pathogenesis originate from the compromised thermal stability of mutant myocilins. In an expansion of our pilot study of four mutants, we compare 21 additional purified OLF variants by using a fluorescence stability assay and investigate the secondary structure of the most stable variants by circular dichroism. Variants with lower melting temperatures are correlated with earlier glaucoma diagnoses. The chemical chaperone trimethylamine N-oxide is capable of restoring the stability of most, but not all, variants to wild-type (WT) levels. Interestingly, three reported OLF disease variants, A427T, G246R, and A445V, exhibited properties indistinguishable from those of WT OLF, but an increased apparent aggregation propensity in vitro relative to that of WT OLF suggests that biophysical factors other than thermal stability, such as kinetics and unfolding pathways, may also be involved in myocilin glaucoma pathogenesis. Similarly, no changes from WT OLF stability and secondary structure were detected for three annotated single-nucleotide polymorphism variants.

Herein, we generated a Gaussia luciferase-based MYOC fusion protein to quickly and sensitively track the secretion of MYOC variants and compared these results to the better-established western blotting assay for MYOC.
METHODS: Fourteen clinically-derived MYOC variants with varying degrees of predicted pathogenicity were transfected into HEK-293A cells and analyzed by either a luciferase assay or western blotting.
RESULTS: Eight of the variants (G12R, V53A, T204T, P254L, T325T, D380H, D395_E396insDP, and P481S) had not been biochemically assessed previously.

11805335,"The human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and an elevated risk of malignancy. Epidemiological data support an increased risk for breast and other cancers in A-T heterozygotes. However, screening breast cancer cases for truncating mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene has failed largely to reveal an increased incidence in these patients. It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization.

Nine variants produced little or no correction of the A-T cellular phenotype and were interpreted to be ATM mutations; SIFT/PolyPhen scores supported this.

Myotubes from the two patients affected by central core disease showed a 4-fold increase in the release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, compared with cells derived from control or malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals. All tested myotubes released calcium from intracellular stores upon stimulation via surface membrane depolarization or direct RYR activation by 4-chloro-m-cresol. The functional impact on calcium release of RYR1 mutations linked to central core disease or malignant hyperthermia is different: human myotubes carrying the malignant hyperthermia-linked RYR1 mutation V2168M had a shift in their sensitivity to the RYR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol to lower concentrations, whereas human myotubes harboring C-terminal mutations linked to central core disease exhibited reduced [Ca2+]i increase in response to 4-chloro-m-cresol, caffeine, and KCl.

We apply this strategy to systematically characterize missense alleles in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene identified through exome sequencing of 3,235 individuals and exome-chip profiling of 39,186 individuals. Our strategy reliably identifies disruptive missense alleles, and disruptive-allele carriers have higher plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).

The mechanisms through which bookmarking factors bind to mitotic chromatin remain poorly understood. HNF1β is a bookmarking transcription factor that is frequently mutated in patients suffering from renal multicystic dysplasia and diabetes. Here, we show that HNF1β bookmarking activity is impaired by naturally occurring mutations found in patients. Interestingly, this defect in HNF1β mitotic chromatin association is rescued by an abrupt decrease in temperature. The rapid relocalization to mitotic chromatin is reversible and driven by a specific switch in DNA-binding ability of HNF1β mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that importin-β is involved in the maintenance of the mitotic retention of HNF1β, suggesting a functional link between the nuclear import system and the mitotic localization/translocation of bookmarking factors.

12712243,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: After screening 16 Korean families with early onset Type 2 diabetes in search for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) -1alpha gene mutation, we identified a novel missense mutation (R263L) associated with MODY phenotype. We studied the biological characteristics of the mutation and the potential functional consequences based on the crystallographic structure of HNF-1alpha in complex with DNA.
METHODS: DNA from subjects with a familial form of early onset diabetes was isolated and HNF-1alpha was sequenced. The R263L substitution was generated by PCR-based sited-directed mutagenesis. Functional and biochemical studies were conducted by reporter assay using glucose-transporter type 2 (GLUT2) or insulin promoters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively.
RESULTS: Transfection of wild-type HNF-1alpha increased the reporter activities of GLUT2 and insulin promoters in NIH3T3 and SK-Hep1 cells, while R263L mutant was defective in transactivation of those promoters. Both wild-type HNF-1alpha and R263L mutant could not transactivate GLUT2 and insulin promoters in MIN6N8 insulinoma cells. R263L mutant had a defective cooperation with its heterodimeric partner HNF-1beta or coactivator p300. R263L mutant protein displayed greatly reduced DNA binding ability, despite its comparable protein stability to the wild-type HNF-1alpha.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the mutation of HNF-1alpha at codon 263 from arginine to leucine leads to the development of MODY3 through decreased insulin production and defective glucose sensing.

21170474,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α (HNF-1α) is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in a variety of tissues (including liver and pancreas) that regulates a wide range of genes. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding HNF-1α (HNF1A) cause familial young-onset diabetes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (MODY3). The variability of the MODY3 clinical phenotype can be due to environmental and genetic factors as well as to the type and position of mutations. Thus, functional characterization of HNF1A mutations might provide insight into the molecular defects explaining the variability of the MODY3 phenotype.

Target DNA binding affinities have been quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-HNF-1α fusion proteins and nuclear extracts of transfected Cos7 cells. Our functional studies revealed that mutation c-57-64delCACGCGGT;c-55G>C reduces HNF1A promoter activity in Min6 cells and that missense mutations have variable effects.

To address this question, we first analyzed fourteen disease-causing amino acid changes using the recently described crystal structure of VLCAD. The predicted effects varied from the replacement of amino acid residues lining the substrate binding cavity, involved in holoenzyme-FAD interactions or in enzyme dimerisation, predicted to have severe functional consequences, up to amino acid substitutions outside key enzyme domains or lying on near enzyme surface, with predicted milder consequences. These data were combined with functional analysis of residual fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and VLCAD protein levels in patient cells harboring these mutations, before and after pharmacological stimulation by bezafibrate. Mutations identified as detrimental to the protein structure in the 3-D model were generally associated to profound FAO and VLCAD protein deficiencies in the patient cells, however, some mutations affecting FAD binding or monomer-monomer interactions allowed a partial response to bezafibrate.

36246652,"Purpose: The addition of Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II) to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in the United States has led to an increase in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and novel variants identified in the GAA gene. This presents a diagnostic challenge, especially in the setting of late-onset Pompe disease when symptoms are rarely apparent at birth. There is an unmet need for validated functional studies to aid in classification of GAA variants. Methods: We developed an in vitro mammalian cell expression and functional analysis system based on guidelines established by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group for PS3/BS3. We validated the assay with 12 control variants and subsequently analyzed eight VUS or novel variants in GAA identified in patients with a positive newborn screen for Pompe disease without phenotypic evidence of infantile-onset disease. Results: The control variants were analyzed in our expression system and an activity range was established. The pathogenic controls had GAA activity between 0% and 11% of normal. The benign or likely benign controls had an activity range of 54%-100%. The pseudodeficiency variant had activity of 17%. These ranges were then applied to the variants selected for functional studies. Using the threshold of &lt;11%, we were able to apply PS3_ supporting to classify two variants as likely pathogenic (c.316C &gt; T and c.1103G &gt; A) and provide further evidence to support the classification of likely pathogenic for two variants (c.1721T &gt; C and c.1048G &gt; A).

We were unable to reclassify three variants (c.664G &gt; A, c.2450A &gt; G, and c.1378G &gt; A) due to insufficient or conflicting evidence. Conclusion: We investigated eight GAA variants as proof of concept using our validated and reproducible in vitro expression and functional analysis system.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic defects in a GT patient.
METHODS: The expression of alphaIIbbeta3 was determined by flow cytometric analysis and Western blotting. We analyzed the cDNA sequences of both alphaIIb and beta3, and performed transfection experiments using COS7 cells to confirm that a specific mutation was responsible for the GT case.
RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis and Western blotting showed remarkably reduced expression of alphaIIbbeta3. Sequence analysis of the patient's cDNA indicated a new missense mutation that led to the amino acid substitution of Ile304 (ATC) with Asn (AAC) in exon 6 of the beta3 gene. This was in addition to the missense mutation of His280 (CAT) to Pro (CCT) in exon 5, which had been previously reported. The missense mutation of Ile304 (ATC) to Asn (AAC) in beta3 was found to be responsible for this GT case. This was because transfection experiments using COS7 cells indicated that alphaIIbbeta3 possessing Asn304 in beta3 was not expressed on the surface of the transfected cells. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that alphaIIbbeta3 was absent inside the transfected COS7 cells possessing Asn304 in beta(3).

To gain insight into the primary pathogenic mechanisms induced by T9176C, we have investigated the consequences of this mutation on the ATP synthase of yeast where Atp6p is also encoded by the mtDNA. In vitro, yeast atp6-T9176C mitochondria showed a 30% decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis. When forcing the F1FO complex to work in the reverse mode, i.e. F1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP coupled to proton transport out of the mitochondrial matrix, the mutant showed a normal proton-pumping activity and this activity was fully sensitive to oligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase proton channel. However, under conditions of maximal ATP hydrolytic activity, using non-osmotically protected mitochondria, the mutant ATPase activity was less efficiently inhibited by oligomycin (60% inhibition versus 85% for the wild type control). Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis analyses revealed that atp6-T9176C yeast accumulated rather good levels of fully assembled ATP synthase complexes. However, a number of sub-complexes (F1, Atp9p-ring, unassembled alpha-F1 subunits) could be detected as well, presumably because of a decreased stability of Atp6p within the ATP synthase. Although the oxidative phosphorylation capacity was reduced in atp6-T9176C yeast, the number of ATP molecules synthesized per electron transferred to oxygen was similar compared with wild type yeast. It can therefore be inferred that the coupling efficiency within the ATP synthase was mostly unaffected and that the T9176C mutation did not increase the proton permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane.",PS3_supporting,NC_012920.1:m.9176T>C,"While cybrid studies were performed (PMID: 19160410), there was insufficient evidence reported to meet criteria for cybrid scoring per the specified guidelines for variant curation.

35163265,"FOXG1 is an ancient transcription factor gene mastering telencephalic development. A number of distinct structural FOXG1 mutations lead to the ""FOXG1 syndrome"", a complex and heterogeneous neuropathological entity, for which no cure is presently available. Reconstruction of primary neurodevelopmental/physiological anomalies evoked by these mutations is an obvious pre-requisite for future, precision therapy of such syndrome. Here, as a proof-of-principle, we functionally scored three FOXG1 neuropathogenic alleles, FOXG1G224S, FOXG1W308X, and FOXG1N232S, against their healthy counterpart. Specifically, we delivered transgenes encoding for them to dedicated preparations of murine pallial precursors and quantified their impact on selected neurodevelopmental and physiological processes mastered by Foxg1: pallial stem cell fate choice, proliferation of neural committed progenitors, neuronal architecture, neuronal activity, and their molecular correlates. Briefly, we found that FOXG1G224S and FOXG1W308X generally performed as a gain- and a loss-of-function-allele, respectively, while FOXG1N232S acted as a mild loss-of-function-allele or phenocopied FOXG1WT. These results provide valuable hints about processes misregulated in patients heterozygous for these mutations, to be re-addressed more stringently in patient iPSC-derivative neuro-organoids.

Careful evaluation of renal biopsy samples revealed a decreased staining of cells induced by COX and NADH dehydrogenase activities, and a strong fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. These anomalies were due to the presence of a mutation in the mitochondrial ATP6 gene, G8969>A. This mutation leads to replacement of a highly conserved serine residue at position 148 of the a-subunit of ATP synthase. Increasing the mutation load in cybrid cell lines was paralleled by the appearance of abnormal mitochondrial morphologies, diminished respiration and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. An equivalent of the G8969>A mutation in yeast had dramatic consequences on ATP synthase, with a block in proton translocation. The mutation was particularly abundant (89%) in the kidney compared to blood and urine, which is likely the reason why this organ was affected first.

Seven subunits of human complex I are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that carry an unexpectedly large number of mutations discovered in mitochondria from patients' tissues. However, whether or how these genetic aberrations affect complex I at a molecular level is unknown. Here, we used Escherichia coli as a model system to biochemically characterize two mutations that were found in mtDNA of patients. The V253AMT-ND5 mutation completely disturbed the assembly of complex I, while the mutation D199GMT-ND1 led to the assembly of a stable complex capable to catalyze redox-driven proton translocation. However, the latter mutation perturbs quinone reduction leading to a diminished activity.

Respiration studies revealed that the 3460A mutation reduced the maximal respiration rate 20-28%, the 11778A mutation 30-36%, and the 14484C mutation 10-15%. The respiration defects of the 3460A and 11778A mutations transferred in cybrid experiments linking these defects to the mtDNA.

2760205,"This paper describes an unusual kindred with familial hypercholesterolemia in which one-third of the relatives with a mutant LDL receptor gene have normal plasma cholesterol concentrations. The proband, a 9-yr-old boy with a plasma cholesterol value greater than 500 mg/dl, is homozygous for a point mutation that changes Ser156 to Leu in the LDL receptor. This substitution in the fourth repeat of the ligand binding domain slows the transport of the protein to the cell surface. The defective receptor cannot bind LDL, which contains apo B-100, but it does bind beta-migrating VLDL, which contains apo E in addition to apo B-100. Although the mother is heterozygous for this mutation, her LDL-cholesterol concentration is consistently in the 28th percentile for the population. Through direct examination of genomic DNA, we identified the mutant gene in heterozygous form in 17 of the mother's relatives, five of whom had normal LDL-cholesterol values. The pedigree was consistent with dominant transmission of a single gene that ameliorates or suppresses the hypercholesterolemic effect of the LDL receptor mutation. Through linkage analysis, we excluded the possibility that this suppressor gene was an allele at the LDL receptor locus. We also excluded the genes for the two ligands for the LDL receptor, apo B-100 and apo E.

28862265,"Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney is a rare tumor (≤25 reported cases) characterized by the presence of cysts, and solid areas composed of bundles of undifferentiated spindle cells, showing marked cellular anaplasia (usually accompanied by TP53 overexpression). These tumors often feature prominent areas of cartilage or chondroid material. Germline mutations in DICER1, encoding the microRNA (miRNA) processor DICER1, cause an eponymous syndrome. Recent reports suggest that anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney should be included in DICER1 syndrome as germline DICER1 mutations are associated with the occurrence of such tumors. Therefore, we sought to determine the following: (1) what proportion of anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney have DICER1 mutations; (2) whether the identified mutations affect both alleles of DICER1 (ie, are biallelic); (3) whether somatic missense mutations in the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain impact miRNA generation; and (4) whether TP53 alteration always occurs in these tumors. DICER1 mutations were evaluated by Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing in nine tumor/normal pairs. Impact of DICER1 mutations on miRNA generation was evaluated via an in vitro DICER1 cleavage assay. TP53 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Eight of the nine cases had at least one RNase IIIb DICER1 mutation that impacted the generation of miRNAs. There were six tumors with truncating DICER1 mutations and in four of them, the mutation found in the tumor was also detected in adjacent normal tissue, and therefore was likely to be either mosaic or germline in origin. Analysis of mutation phase revealed that two of three tumors had biallelic DICER1 mutations. Six of nine anaplastic sarcomas of the kidney had aberrant TP53 immunohistochemisty with damaging TP53 mutations identified in three cases.

37333613,"The endoribonuclease DICER1 plays an essential role in the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway, cleaving precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) stem-loops to generate mature single-stranded miRNAs. Germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in DICER1 result in DICER1 tumor predisposition syndrome (DTPS), a mainly childhood-onset tumor susceptibility disorder. Most DTPS-causing GPVs are nonsense or frameshifting, with tumor development requiring a second somatic missense hit that impairs the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain. Interestingly, germline DICER1 missense variants that cluster in the DICER1 Platform domain have been identified in some persons affected by tumors that also associate with DTPS. Here, we demonstrate that four of these Platform domain variants prevent DICER1 from producing mature miRNAs and as a result impair miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Importantly, we show that in contrast to canonical somatic missense variants that alter DICER1 cleavage activity, DICER1 proteins harboring these Platform variants fail to bind to pre-miRNA stem-loops.

28687594,"Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cause malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD), whereas mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) lead to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Most disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations are located in the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of the corresponding ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoform. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release during store Ca2+ overload, a process known as store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Considering the similar locations of disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations in the RyR structure, we hypothesize that like CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations, MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations also enhance SOICR. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact on SOICR of 12 MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations E2347-del, R2163H, G2434R, R2435L, R2435H, and R2454H located in the central region, and Y4796C, T4826I, L4838V, A4940T, G4943V, and P4973L located in the C-terminal region of the channel.

Dantrolene, an acute treatment for MH, suppressed SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing the RyR1 mutants R164C, Y523S, R2136H, R2435H, and Y4796C. Interestingly, carvedilol, a commonly used β-blocker that suppresses RyR2-mediated SOICR, also inhibits SOICR in these RyR1 mutant HEK293 cells. Therefore, these results indicate that a reduced SOICR threshold is a common defect of MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations, and that carvedilol, like dantrolene, can suppress RyR1-mediated SOICR. Clinical studies of the effectiveness of carvedilol as a long-term treatment for MH/CCD or other RyR1-associated disorders may be warranted.",PS3_supporting,NM_000540.3:c.14512C>G,A functional study in CHO cells shows an increased sensitivity to RYR1 agonists,,1,"Gene: RYR1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_38580370_C_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_39071010_C_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.38580370C>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.39071010C>G, rsID: rs193922878, HGVSc: c.14512C>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Leu4838Val, HGVSp (1-letter): p.L4838V"

METHODS: We observed the general phenotype; determined the sensitivity of myotubes to caffeine-, KCl, and halothane-induced Ca2+ release; determined the in vivo response to halothane or increased ambient temperature; and determined the in vivo myoplasmic intracellular Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle before and during exposure to volatile anaesthetics.

VLCAD deficiency is clinically heterogenous, with three major phenotypes: a severe childhood form, with early onset, high mortality, and high incidence of cardiomyopathy; a milder childhood form, with later onset, usually with hypoketotic hypoglycemia as the main presenting feature, low mortality, and rare cardiomyopathy; and an adult form, with isolated skeletal muscle involvement, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, usually triggered by exercise or fasting. To examine whether these different phenotypes are due to differences in the VLCAD genotype, we investigated 58 different mutations in 55 unrelated patients representing all known clinical phenotypes and correlated the mutation type with the clinical phenotype. Our results show a clear relationship between the nature of the mutation and the severity of disease. Patients with the severe childhood phenotype have mutations that result in no residual enzyme activity, whereas patients with the milder childhood and adult phenotypes have mutations that may result in residual enzyme activity.

21918424,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) result in malignant hyperthermia, a pharmacogenetic disorder typically triggered by administration of anesthetics. However, cases of sudden death during exertion, heat challenge, and febrile illness in the absence of triggering drugs have been reported. The underlying causes of such drug-free fatal ""awake"" episodes are unknown.
METHODS: De novo R3983C variant in RYR1 was identified in two unrelated children who experienced fatal, nonanesthetic awake episodes associated with febrile illness and heat stress. One of the children also had a second novel, maternally inherited D4505H variant located on a separate haplotype. Effects of all possible heterotypic expression conditions on RYR1 sensitivity to caffeine-induced Ca release were determined in expressing RYR1-null myotubes.
RESULTS: Compared with wild-type RYR1 alone (EC50 = 2.85 ± 0.49 mM), average (± SEM) caffeine sensitivity of Ca release was modestly increased after coexpression with either R3983C (EC50 = 2.00 ± 0.39 mM) or D4505H (EC50 = 1.64 ± 0.24 mM). Remarkably, coexpression of wild-type RYR1 with the double mutant in cis (R3983C-D4505H) produced a significantly stronger sensitization of caffeine-induced Ca release (EC50 = 0.64 ± 0.17 mM) compared with that observed after coexpression of the two variants on separate subunits (EC50 = 1.53 ± 0.18 mM).
CONCLUSIONS: The R3983C mutation potentiates D4505H-mediated sensitization of caffeine-induced RYR1 Ca release when the mutations are in cis (on the same subunit) but not when present on separate subunits. Nevertheless, coexpression of the two variants on separate subunits still resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in caffeine sensitivity, consistent with the observed awake episodes and heat sensitivity.",BS3_supporting,NM_000540.3:c.11947C>T,Functional studies in HEK293 cells have not shown a significant increase in sensitivity to RYR1 agonists,Functional studies in HEK293 cells have not shown a significant increase in sensitivity to RYR1 agonists,1,"Gene: RYR1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_38543810_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_39034450_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.38543810C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.39034450C>T, rsID: rs1600989183, HGVSc: c.11947C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg3983Cys, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R3983C"

There are no treatments for this severe group of diseases. A major barrier to therapy development is the lack of an animal model that mirrors the clinical severity of pediatric cases of the disease. To address this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate a novel recessive mouse model of RYR1 RM. This mouse (Ryr1TM/Indel) possesses a patient-relevant point mutation (T4706M) engineered into 1 allele and a 16 base pair frameshift deletion engineered into the second allele. Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit an overt phenotype beginning at 14 days of age that consists of reduced body/muscle mass and myofibre hypotrophy. Ryr1TM/Indel mice become progressively inactive from that point onward and die at a median age of 42 days. Histopathological assessment shows myofibre hypotrophy, increased central nuclei and decreased triad number but no clear evidence of metabolic cores. Biochemical analysis reveals a marked decrease in RYR1 protein levels (20% of normal) as compared to only a 50% decrease in transcript. Functional studies at end stage show significantly reduced electrically evoked Ca2+ release and force production. In summary, Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit a post-natal lethal recessive form of RYR1 RM that pheno-copies the severe congenital clinical presentation seen in a subgroup of RYR1 RM children.

Sequencing of the cDNA from a cell line (GM 244) derived from a patient with Pompe disease demonstrated a T953-to-C transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. The basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for NcoI and StyI. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed both a normal and an abnormal NcoI fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. NcoI and StyI digestion of cDNA, amplified by PCR from reverse-transcribed RNA, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the GAA mRNA in GM 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. The missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional GAA-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic DNA with NcoI and hybridization. The amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for N-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. We could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express GAA enzyme activity after transient gene expression.

More than 100 cases of VLCAD deficiency have been reported with the disease varying from a severe, often fatal neonatal form to a mild adult-onset form. VLCAD is distinguished from matrix-soluble acyl-CoA dehydrogenases by its unique C-terminal domain, homodimeric structure, and localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have for the first time expressed and purified VLCAD using a bacterial system. Recombinant VLCAD had similar biochemical properties to those reported for native VLCAD and the bacterial system was used to study six previously described disease-causing missense mutations including the two most common mild mutations (T220M, V243A), a mutation leading to the severe disease phenotype (R429W), and three mutations in the C-terminal domain (A450P, L462P, and R573W). Of particular interest was the finding that the A450P and L462P bacterial extracts had normal or increased amounts of VLCAD antigen and activity. In the pure form L462P had roughly 30% of wild-type activity while A450P was normal. Using computer modeling both mutations were mapped to a predicted charged surface of VLCAD that we postulate interacts with the mitochondrial membrane.

24715333,"BACKGROUND: Enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease--an inherited metabolic disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase deficiency and characterized in infants by generalized muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy--can be complicated by immune responses. Infants that do not produce any endogenous acid α-glucosidase, so-called CRIM-negative patients, reportedly develop a strong response. We report the clinical outcome of our Dutch infants in relation to their CRIM status and immune response.
METHODS: Eleven patients were genotyped and their CRIM status was determined. Antibody formation and clinical outcome were assessed for a minimum of 4 years.
RESULTS: ERT was commenced between 0.1 and 8.3 months of age, and patients were treated from 0.3 to 13.7 years. All patients developed antibodies. Those with a high antibody titer (above 1:31,250) had a poor response. The antibody titers varied substantially between patients and did not strictly correlate with the patients' CRIM status. Patients who started ERT beyond 2 months of age tended to develop higher titers than those who started earlier. All three CRIM-negative patients in our study succumbed by the age of 4 years seemingly unrelated to the height of their antibody titer.
CONCLUSION: Antibody formation is a common response to ERT in classic infantile Pompe disease and counteracts the effect of treatment. The counteracting effect seems determined by the antibody:enzyme molecular stoichiometry.

Furthermore, binding and mobility dynamics show a gradient of impairment depending on the amino acid properties and tertiary structure within the MBD. Interestingly, a wide range of phenotypic/clinical severity, ranging from neonatal encephalopathy to mild psychiatric abnormalities were observed and all are consistent with our functional/molecular results. Overall, clinical severity showed a direct correlation with the functional impairment of MeCP2.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the molecular basis of GT and characterize the mutations by in vitro expression studies.
PATIENTS: We studied three unrelated patients from southern India whose diagnosis was consistent with GT.
RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates and immunoblotting showed no detectable mature alpha(IIb) in the G128S mutant, in contrast to 6% and 33% of the normal amount of mature alpha(IIb) in the S287L and G357S mutants, respectively. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated pro-alpha(IIb) in the mutants comparable with the normal pro-alpha(IIb), but no conversion to mature alpha(IIb) in the G128S mutant, and only trace conversion to mature alpha(IIb) in the S287L and G357S mutants. The disappearance of pro-alpha(IIb) in the three mutants was similar to that in cells expressing normal alpha(IIb)beta3 or alpha(IIb) only.

21029361,"BACKGROUND: Studies of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT)-causing mutations has generated invaluable information on the formation and function of integrin αIIbβ(3).
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mutation in four siblings of an Israeli Arab family affected by GT, and to analyze the relationships between the mutant protein structure and its function using artificial mutations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sequencing disclosed a new A97G transversion in the αIIb gene predicting Asn2Asp substitution at blade 1 of the β-propeller. Alignment with other integrin α subunits revealed that Asn2 is highly conserved. No surface expression of αIIbβ(3) was found in patients' platelets and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with mutated αIIb and WT β(3). Although the αIIbβ(3) was formed, the mutation impaired its intracellular trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations and modeling of the αIIbβ(3) crystal indicated that the Asn2Asp mutation disrupts a hydrogen bond between Asn2 and Leu366 of a calcium binding domain in blade 6, thereby impairing calcium binding that is essential for intracellular trafficking of αIIbβ(3). Substitution of Asn2 to uncharged Ala or Gln partially decreased αIIbβ(3) surface expression, while substitution by negatively or positively charged residues completely abolished surface expression. Unlike αIIbβ(3), αVβ(3) harboring the Asn2Asp mutation was surface expressed by transfected BHK cells, which is consistent with the known lower sensitivity of αVβ(3) to calcium chelation compared with αIIbβ(3).
CONCLUSION: The new GT causing mutation highlights the importance of calcium binding domains in the β-propeller for intracellular trafficking of αIIbβ(3).

9461620,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is one of four flavoproteins which catalyze the initial step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation spiral. By sequence comparison with other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, Glu-422 of VLCAD has been presumed to be the catalytic residue that abstracts the alpha-proton in the alphabeta-dehydrogenation reaction. Replacing Glu-422 with glutamine (E422Q) caused a loss of enzyme activity by preventing the formation of a charge transfer complex between VLCAD and palmitoyl-CoA. This result provides further evidence for Glu-422 being part of the active site of VLCAD. F418L is a disease-causing mutation in human VLCAD deficiency. Unlike wild-type VLCAD, F418L and F418V contained no bound FAD when expressed at extremely high levels in the baculovirus expression system. Although F418T and F418Y bound FAD at a level similar to that of wild-type VLCAD, both showed reduced Vmax values toward palmitoyl-CoA, most likely due to a decrease in the rate of enzyme-bound FAD reduction. These data suggest that Phe-418 is involved in the binding and subsequent reduction of FAD. FAD-deficient VLCADs (F418L, F418V, and apo-VLCAD) showed increased sensitivity to trypsinization.

The N-terminal domain of the LDLR harbours the ligand-binding domain consisting of seven cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids each. Mutations in the LDLR binding domain may result in loss of receptor activity leading to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this study the activity of six mutations located in the cysteine-rich repeats of the LDLR has been investigated.
METHODS: CHO-ldlA7 transfected cells with six different LDLR mutations have been used to analyse in vitro LDLR expression, lipoprotein binding and uptake. Immunoblotting of cell extracts, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy have been performed to determine the effects of these mutations. In silico analysis was also performed to predict the mutation effect.

We have now been able to further assess the molecular aetiology associated with 3302A>G in transmitochondrial cybrids. Increased steady-state levels of RNA19 was confirmed, although not to the levels previously reported in muscle. This data was consistent with an increase in RNA19 stability. The mutation resulted in decreased mt-tRNA(Leu(UUR)) levels, but its stability was unchanged, consistent with a defect in RNA19 processing responsible for low tRNA levels.

12655007,"The human mitochondrial genome encodes 22 tRNAs interspersed among the two rRNAs and 11 mRNAs, often without spacers, suggesting that tRNAs must be efficiently excised. Numerous maternally transmitted diseases and syndromes arise from mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs, likely due to defect(s) in tRNA metabolism. We have systematically explored the effect of pathogenic mutations on tRNA(Ile) precursor 3' end maturation in vitro by 3'-tRNase. Strikingly, four pathogenic tRNA(Ile) mutations reduce 3'-tRNase processing efficiency (V(max) / K(M)) to approximately 10-fold below that of wild-type, principally due to lower V(max). The structural impact of mutations was sought by secondary structure probing and wild-type tRNA(Ile) precursor was found to fold into a canonical cloverleaf. Among the mutant tRNA(Ile) precursors with the greatest 3' end processing deficiencies, only G4309A displays a secondary structure substantially different from wild-type, with changes in the T domain proximal to the substitution.

22698810,"In about 20-30% of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, phenylalanine (Phe) levels can be controlled by cofactor 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) administration. The phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype has a predictive value concerning BH(4)-response and therefore a correct assessment of the mutation molecular pathology is important. Mutations that disturb the splicing of exons (e.g. interplay between splice site strength and regulatory sequences like exon splicing enhancers (ESEs)/exon splicing silencers (ESSs)) may cause different severity of PKU. In this study, we identified PAH exon 11 as a vulnerable exon and used patient derived lymphoblast cell lines and PAH minigenes to study the molecular defect that impacted pre-mRNA processing. We showed that the c.1144T>C and c.1066-3C>T mutations cause exon 11 skipping, while the c.1139C>T mutation is neutral or slightly beneficial. The c.1144T>C mutation resides in a putative splicing enhancer motif and binding by splicing factors SF2/ASF, SRp20 and SRp40 is disturbed. Additional mutations in potential splicing factor binding sites contributed to elucidate the pathogenesis of mutations in PAH exon 11. We suggest that PAH exon 11 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site and that this makes exon 11 inclusion dependent on an ESE spanning position c.1144. Importantly, this implies that other mutations in exon 11 may affect splicing, since splicing is often determined by a fine balance between several positive and negative splicing regulatory elements distributed throughout the exon. Finally, we identified a pseudoexon in intron 11, which would have pathogenic consequences if activated by mutations or improved splicing conditions. Exonic mutations that disrupt splicing are unlikely to facilitate response to BH(4) and may lead to inconsistent genotype-phenotype correlations.

36922881,"BACKGROUND: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare mesenchymal malignancy of the lung and is the most common pulmonary malignancy in infants and children. Cystic PPB, the earliest form of PPB occurring from birth to approximately two years of age, is often mistaken for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation, as the two entities can be difficult to distinguish on imaging and pathology. Diagnosis of PPB should prompt workup for DICER1 syndrome, an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome. We report a newborn with a congenital PPB presenting with tachypnea and hypoxia, who was found to have variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in DICER1.
CASE PRESENTATION: A term female infant developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. Initial imaging was concerning for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation versus congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and she was transferred to a quaternary neonatal intensive care unit for management and workup. Chest CT angiography demonstrated a macrocytic multicystic lesion within the right lower lobe without systemic arterial supply. The pediatric surgery team was consulted, and the neonate underwent right lower lobectomy. Pathology revealed a type I PPB. Oncology and genetics consultants recommended observation without chemotherapy and single gene sequencing of DICER1, which identified a germline VUS in DICER1 predicted to alter splicing. RNA-sequencing from blood demonstrated that the variant resulted in an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids in a majority of transcripts from the affected allele. Due to the patient's young age at presentation and high clinical suspicion for DICER1 syndrome, tumor surveillance was initiated. Renal and pelvic ultrasonography were unremarkable.
CONCLUSION: We present the case of a term neonate with respiratory distress and cystic lung mass, found to have a type I PPB with a germline VUS in DICER1 that likely increased her risk of DICER1-related tumors. Nearly 70% of patients with PPB demonstrate germline mutations in DICER1. Review of RNA sequencing data demonstrates the difficulty in classifying splice variants such as this. Penetrance is low, and many patients with pathogenic DICER1 variants do not develop a malignancy.

Cases had either no candidate variant identified by prior testing or a VUS suspected to impact splicing or expression. A committee reviewed each submission to ensure it met study criteria.
RESULTS: Among 26 cases, 8 could not be sequenced because of poor expression in an accessible tissue, 2 did not meet inclusion criteria, 3 were solved prior to collection, and 4 families declined participation or did not complete sample collection. For the 9 cases sequenced, the clinical laboratory reported two positive, four negative, and three ""indeterminate."" For all three indeterminate cases, original RNA-seq data was manually evaluated and deemed explanatory.

32273537,"Radiobiology is moving towards a better understanding of the intercellular signaling that occurs upon radiation and how its effects relate to the dose applied. The mitochondrial role in orchestrating this biological response needs to be further explored. Cybrids (cytoplasmic hybrids) are useful cell models for studying the involvement of mitochondria in cellular processes. In the present study we used cybrid cell lines to investigate the role of mitochondria in the response to radiation exposure. Cybrid cell lines, derived from the osteosarcoma human cell line 143B, harboring, either wild-type mitochondrial DNA (Cy143Bwt), cells with mitochondria with mutated DNA that causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Cy143Bmut), as well as cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (143B-Rho0), were irradiated with 0.2 Gy and 2.0 Gy. Evaluation of the non-targeted (or bystander) effects in non-irradiated cells were assessed by using conditioned media from the irradiated cells. DNA double stranded breaks were assessed with the γH2AX assay. Both directly irradiated cells and cells treated with the conditioned media, showed increased DNA damage. The effect of the irradiated cells media was different according to the cell line it derived from: from Cy143Bwt cells irradiated with 0.2 Gy (low dose) and from Cy143Bmut irradiated with 2.0 Gy (high dose) induced highest DNA damage. Notably, media obtained from cells without mtDNA, the143B-Rho0 cell line, produced no effect in DNA damage.

The genetic investigation of Greek adenomatous polyposis families was performed in respects to APC and MUTYH germline mutations. Additionally, all available published mutations were considered in order to define the APC mutation spectrum in Greece.
METHODS: A cohort of 25 unrelated adenomatous polyposis families of Greek origin has been selected. Genetic testing included direct sequencing of APC and MUTYH genes. APC gene was also checked for large genomic rearrangements by MLPA.
RESULTS: Analysis of the APC gene performed in a Greek cohort of twenty five FAP families revealed eighteen different germline mutations in twenty families (80%), four of which novel. Mutations were scattered between exon 3 and codon 1503 of exon 15, while no large genomic rearrangements were identified.

18166348,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We identified the APC N1026S variant of unknown malignant potential in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in a Spanish attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) family. The variant was located in the first of the 4 highly conserved 15-amino acid (AA) repeats within the beta-catenin union domain. Our aim was to determine its functional relevance to establish its pathogenicity.
METHODS: N1026S variant was analyzed in 22 members of the AFAP family studied, in 236 sporadic colorectal cancer cases, 203 matched controls, and 205 unrelated familial colorectal cancer cases. To assess its effects on beta-catenin binding, beta-catenin/Tcf-4-mediated transcription and beta-catenin subcellular distribution we performed affinity chromatography experiments, BIAcore 1000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) assays, luciferase reporter assays, assessment of c-myc messenger RNA levels, and cell fractionation.
RESULTS: N1026S variant cosegregated with the disease in the AFAP family studied. None of the sporadic or familial cases as well as the controls analyzed was positive for the variant. N1026S variant completely precluded beta-catenin binding to the first 15-AA repeat and diminished it when all four 15-AA repeats were present. Expression of APC N1026S in SW480 and DLD-1 cells did not diminish beta-catenin/Tcf-4-mediated transcription as effectively as APC wild-type. N1026S did not decrease c-myc transcription in DLD1 cells and nuclear beta-catenin in SW480 cells as effectively as WT.

15233628,"HNF4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) belongs to a complex transcription factor network that is crucial for the function of hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells. In these cells, it activates the expression of a very large number of genes, including genes involved in the transport and metabolism of glucose and lipids. Mutations in the HNF4alpha gene correlate with MODY1 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1), a form of type II diabetes characterized by an impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. The MODY1 G115S (Gly115-->Ser) HNF4alpha mutation is located in the DNA-binding domain of this nuclear receptor. We show here that the G115S mutation failed to affect HNF4alpha-mediated transcription on apolipoprotein promoters in HepG2 cells. Conversely, in pancreatic beta-cell lines, this mutation resulted in strong impairments of HNF4alpha transcriptional activity on the promoters of LPK (liver pyruvate kinase) and HNF1alpha, with this transcription factor playing a key role in endocrine pancreas. We show as well that the G115S mutation creates a PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation site, and that PKA-mediated phosphorylation results in a decreased transcriptional activity of the mutant. Moreover, the G115E (Gly115-->Glu) mutation mimicking phosphorylation reduced HNF4alpha DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. Our results may account for the 100% penetrance of diabetes in human carriers of this mutation. In addition, they suggest that introduction of a phosphorylation site in the DNA-binding domain may represent a new mechanism by which a MODY1 mutation leads to loss of HNF4alpha function.",PS3_supporting,NM_175914.5:c.337G>C,Functional studies have demonstrated the p.

To fulfill the World Health Organization recommendation, the Portuguese FH Study was established. Here, we report the results of the past 15 years and present practical considerations concerning the genetic diagnosis of FH based on our experience.
METHODS: Our approach comprises a biochemical and molecular study and is divided into five phases, including the study of whole APOB and functional assays.
RESULTS: A total of 2,122 individuals were enrolled. A putative pathogenic variant was identified in 660 heterozygous patients: LDLR (623), APOB (33), and PCSK9 (4); 8 patients presented with homozygous FH. A detection rate of 41.5% was observed. A stricter biochemical criteria was shown to improve patient identification. Overall, we have identified 3.4% and 80% of all heterozygous and homozygous patients, respectively, estimated to exist in our country.
CONCLUSION: The Portuguese FH Study has established the genetic diagnosis of FH in Portugal and is committed to continue the investigation of the genetic complexity of FH. Genetic diagnosis of FH should be expanded to include the study of all coding/flanking regions of APOB and functional in vitro studies, to improve the correct patient identification, and to avoid misdiagnosis.Genet Med 18 4, 316-324.",BS3_supporting,NM_000527.5:c.1920C>T,,"Level 3 assay with heterozygous patients’ lymphocytes, RNA assays shown normal LDLR transcripts, reported by Medeiros et al, 2016, from Instituto Nacional de Saude Doutor Ricardo Jorge, Lisbon, Portugal.

The current study investigated the reasons for the higher prevalence of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy in males, exploring the potential compensatory effects of oestrogens on mutant cell metabolism. Control and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy osteosarcoma-derived cybrids (11778/ND4, 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6) were grown in glucose or glucose-free, galactose-supplemented medium. After having shown the nuclear and mitochondrial localization of oestrogen receptors in cybrids, experiments were carried out by adding 100 nM of 17β-oestradiol. In a set of experiments, cells were pre-incubated with the oestrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy cybrids in galactose medium presented overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which led to decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased apoptotic rate, loss of cell viability and hyper-fragmented mitochondrial morphology compared with control cybrids. Treatment with 17β-oestradiol significantly rescued these pathological features and led to the activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2. In addition, 17β-oestradiol induced a general activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and a small although significant improvement in energetic competence. All these effects were oestrogen receptor mediated. Finally, we showed that the oestrogen receptor β localizes to the mitochondrial network of human retinal ganglion cells.

Both cell lines also displayed an anomalous response to oligomycin, with rapid onset of depolarization that was prevented by cyclosporin A and by overexpression of Bcl-2. These findings indicate that depolarization by respiratory chain inhibitors and oligomycin was due to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP).

15100232,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a modular protein involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. Mutations to the receptor result in familial hypercholesterolemia, and over 60 of these occur in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain pair. Two selected mutations in this region (G322S and R329P) were introduced into the domain pair and analyzed by in vitro refolding. Both exhibited differing levels of protein misfolding with R329P being the most pronounced. Solution NMR studies of the mutant domain pairs after purification established that a fraction of protein maintains a native-like fold and that this fraction contains two intact calcium-binding sites. An in vivo analysis of intact receptors containing these binding sites showed significantly reduced cell-surface expression compared with the native LDL receptor levels, again with R329P showing the most severe decrease. The sum of these results suggests that either local changes in structure or domain misfolding may be associated with the mutations. There is also the possibility that the misfolding of the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like pair region is propagated to other regions of the intact receptor, resulting in more global defects.

The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic mutations in FH patients and verify their pathogenicity. First of all, a pedigree investigation was conducted in one family diagnosed with FH using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. The high-throughput sequencing was performed on three family members to explore genetic mutations. The effects of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) variants on their expression levels and activity were further validated by silico analysis and functional studies. The results revealed that LDLC levels of the proband and his daughter were abnormally elevated.

Bioinformatic analysis (Mutationtaster) indicated that these two mutations might be disease-causing variants. In vitro experiments suggested that LDLR c.226 G &gt; C and c.1003 G &gt; T could attenuate the uptake of Dil-LDL by LDLR.

24671153,"BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease that primarily results from mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. We investigated two unrelated Chinese FH patients using gene screening and functional analysis to reveal the pathogenicity and the mechanism by which these mutations cause FH.
METHODS: First, the LDLR gene was sequenced in these patients. Then, mutant receptors were transfected into human embryo kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells, and a confocal laser-scanning microscope was used to observe the localization of mutant proteins. Further, the expression and the internalization activity were analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, LDLR protein expression and stability was detected by western blot.
RESULTS: Two different LDLR class 2B mutations were detected in two patients. The C201F mutation is a known mutation. However, the G615V mutation is novel. Flow cytometry showed that the expression and internalization activity of the mutant LDLRs were reduced to 73.6% and 82.6% for G615V and 33.2% and 33.5% for C201F, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two LDLR mutations in Chinese patients with FH and analyzed the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of these patients. We found that these mutant LDLRs were defective in transport, which led to a reduction in cholesterol clearance.

30191603,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a master regulator of development and function of digestive tissues. The HNF4A gene uses two separate promoters P1 and P2, with P1 products predominant in adult liver, whereas P2 products prevalent in fetal liver, pancreas, and liver/colon cancer. To date, the mechanisms for the regulation of HNF4A and the dynamic switch of P1-HNF4α and P2-HNF4α during ontogenesis and carcinogenesis are still obscure. Our study validated the previously reported self-stimulation of P1-HNF4α but invalidated the reported synergism between HNF4α and HNF1α. HNF4A-AS1, a long noncoding RNA, is localized between the P2 and P1 promoters of HNF4A. We identified critical roles of P1-HNF4α in regulating the expression of HNF4A-AS1 and its mouse ortholog Hnf4a-os. Paired box 6 (PAX6), a master regulator of pancreas development overexpressed in colon cancer, cooperated with HNF1α to induce P2-HNF4α but antagonized HNF4α in HNF4A-AS1 expression. Thus, PAX6 may be important in determining ontogenic and carcinogenic changes of P2-HNF4α and HNF4A-AS1 in the pancreas and intestine. We also interrogated transactivation activities on multiple gene targets by multiple known and novel HNF4α mutants identified in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1) and liver cancer. Particularly, HNF4α-D78A and HNF4α-G79S, two mutants found in liver cancer with mutations in DNA-binding domain, displayed highly gene-specific transactivation activities. Interestingly, HNF4α-Q277X, a MODY1 truncation mutant, antagonized the transactivation activities of HNF1α and farnesoid X receptor, key regulators of insulin secretion.

35615698,"Trabecular meshwork dysfunction is the main cause of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Mutant myocilin causes glaucoma mainly via elevating IOP. Previously we have found that accumulated Asn 450 Tyr (N450Y) mutant myocilin impairs human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells by inducing chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in vitro. However, it is unclear how ER stress leads to TM damage and whether N450Y myocilin mutation is associated with POAG in vivo. Here we found that N450Y mutant myocilin induces autophagy, which worsens cell viability, whereas inhibition of autophagy increases viability and decreases cell death in human TM cells. Furthermore, we construct a transgenic mouse model of N450Y myocilin mutation (Tg-MYOCN450Y) and Tg-MYOCN450Y mice exhibiting glaucoma phenotypes: IOP elevation, retinal ganglion cell loss and visual impairment. Consistent with our published in vitro studies, mutant myocilin fails to secrete into aqueous humor, causes ER stress and actives autophagy in Tg-MYOCN450Y mice, and aqueous humor dynamics are altered in Tg-MYOCN450Y mice.

18436825,"PURPOSE: To developed a genetic mouse model of primary open-angle glaucoma induced by expression of mutated human myocilin in transgenic mice and to test whether expression of mutated human myocilin in the eye angle structures produces more significant damage to the eye than does mutated mouse myocilin.
METHODS: Recombineering in Escherichia coli was used to introduce the Tyr437His point mutation into a BAC carrying the full-length human MYOCILIN (MYOC) gene and long flanking regions. This BAC was used to produce transgenic mice. The expression of myocilin in the iridocorneal angle tissues and aqueous humor was studied by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Intraocular pressure was measured noninvasively with a fiber optic transducer. Retinal ganglion cells were retrograde labeled with fluorescent gold, and counted 5 days after labeling.
RESULTS: BAC transgenic mice expressed elevated levels of myocilin in tissues of the iridocorneal angle. Expression of mutated myocilin induced its intracellular accumulation and prevented secretion of both mutated and wild-type myocilin into the aqueous humor. Transgenic mice demonstrated a moderate elevation of intraocular pressure, which was more pronounced at night than in daytime. In the peripheral retina, transgenic mice lost 20% of the retinal ganglion cells and 55% of large retinal ganglion cells. Axonal degeneration was observed at the periphery of the optic nerve.

Four patients were diagnosed through the expanded NBS program with tandem mass spectrometry; one patient was previously diagnosed in a pilot study preceding the NBS implementation. Confirmatory testing consisted of acylcarnitines analysis in dried blood spots, organic acids profiling in urine, genetic analysis of ACADVL gene, and enzyme activity determination in lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Four newborns with specific elevation of acylcarnitines diagnostic for VLCADD and disease-specific acylcarnitines ratios (C14:1, C14, C14:2, C14:1/C2, C14:1/C16) were confirmed with genetic testing: all were compound heterozygotes, two of them had one previously unreported ACDVL gene variant each (NM_000018.3) c.1538C &gt; G; (NP_000009) p.(Ala513Gly) and c.661A &gt; G; p.(Ser221Gly), respectively. In addition, one patient diagnosed in the pilot study also had a specific elevation of acylcarnitines. Subsequent ACDVL genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosity.

The aim of this study was to determine the minimum prevalence of GCK-MODY amongst diabetic subjects in Slovakia by sequencing GCK in 100 Slovakian probands with a phenotype consistent with GCK-MODY and to explore the pathogenicity of identified variants through family and functional studies. Twenty-two mutations were identified in 36 families (17 missense) of which 7 (I110N, V200A, N204D, G258R, F419S, c.580-2A>C, c.1113-1114delGC) were novel. Parental DNA was available for 22 probands (covering 14/22 mutations) and co-segregation established in all cases. Bioinformatic analysis predicted all missense mutations to be damaging. Nine (I110N, V200A, N204D, G223S, G258R, F419S, V244G, L315H, I436N) mutations were functionally evaluated.

AIMS: To evaluate the validity of standard diagnostic procedures for VLCADD by using functional in vitro tools.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 13 patient samples referred to our laboratory because of a suspicion of VLCADD but with some uncertainty to the diagnosis. All 13 patients were suspected of having VLCADD either because of abnormal NBS or suggestive clinical findings. ACADVL genomic DNA sequencing data were available for twelve of them. Ten of the patients had an abnormal NBS suggestive of VLCADD, with three samples showing equivocal results. Three exhibited suggestive clinical findings and blood acylcarnitine profile (two of them had a normal NBS and the third one was unscreened). Assay of VLCAD activity and immunoblotting or immunohistologic staining for VLCAD were performed on fibroblasts. Prokaryotic mutagenesis and expression studies were performed for nine uncharacterized ACADVL missense mutations.
RESULTS: VLCAD activity was abnormal in fibroblast cells from 9 patients (8 identified through abnormal NBS, 1 through clinical symptoms). For these 9 patients, immunoblotting/staining showed the variable presence of VLCAD; all but one had two mutated alleles. Two patients with equivocal NBS results (and a heterozygous genotype) and the two patients with normal NBS exhibited normal VLCAD activity and normal VLCAD protein on immunoblotting/staining thus ruling out VLCAD deficiency. Nine pathogenic missense mutations were characterized with prokaryotic expression studies and showed a decrease in enzyme activity and variable stability of VLCAD antigen.

17186219,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Glucokinase (GCK) acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta cell and regulates insulin secretion. In the gene encoding GCK the heterozygous mutations that result in enzyme inactivation cause MODY2. Functional studies of naturally occurring GCK mutations associated with hyperglycaemia provide further insight into the biochemical basis of glucose sensor regulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification of GCK mutations in selected MODY patients was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The kinetic parameters and thermal stability of recombinant mutant human GCK were determined, and in pull-down assays the effect of these mutations on the association of GCK with glucokinase (hexokinase 4) regulator (GCKR, also known as glucokinase regulatory protein [GKRP]) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB1, also known as PFK2) was tested.
RESULTS: We identified three novel GCK mutations: the insertion of an asparagine residue at position 161 (inserN161) and two missense mutations (M235V and R308W). We also identified a fourth mutation (R397L) reported in a previous work. Functional characterisation of these mutations revealed that insertion of asparagine residue N161 fully inactivates GCK, whereas the M235V and R308W mutations only partially impair enzymatic activity. In contrast, GCK kinetics was almost unaffected by the R397L mutation. Although none of these mutations affected the interaction of GCK with PFKFB1, we found that the R308W mutation caused protein instability and increased the strength of interaction with GCKR.

The objective of the present study was to examine clinical and molecular characteristics of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in Thailand.
METHODS: Twelve patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) including 10 Thai and two other Asian ethnicities were enrolled. To examine the molecular characteristics of Pompe patients, GAA gene was analyzed by PCR amplification and direct Sanger-sequencing of 20 exons coding region. The novel mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells for functional verification. The severity of the mutation was rated by study of the GAA enzyme activity detected in transfected cells and culture media, as well as the quantity and quality of the proper sized GAA protein demonstrated by western blot analysis. The GAA three dimensional structures were visualized by PyMol software tool.
RESULTS: All patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, generalized muscle weakness, and undetectable or < 1% of GAA normal activity. Three patients received enzyme replacement therapy with variable outcome depending on the age of the start of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause mild fasting hyperglycemia irrespective of mutation severity due to compensation from the unaffected allele. Conversely, homozygous loss-of-function mutations cause permanent neonatal diabetes requiring lifelong insulin treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between in vitro mutation severity and clinical phenotype in a large international case series of patients with homozygous GCK mutations. Clinical characteristics for 30 patients with diabetes due to homozygous GCK mutations (19 unique mutations, including 16 missense) were compiled and assigned a clinical severity grade (CSG) based on birth weight and age at diagnosis. The majority (28 of 30) of subjects were diagnosed before 9 months, with the remaining two at 9 and 15 years. These are the first two cases of a homozygous GCK mutation diagnosed outside infancy. Recombinant mutant GCK proteins were analyzed for kinetic and thermostability characteristics and assigned a relative activity index (RAI) or relative stability index (RSI) value. Six of 16 missense mutations exhibited severe kinetic defects (RAI ≤ 0.01). There was no correlation between CSG and RAI (r(2) = 0.05, P = 0.39), indicating that kinetics alone did not explain the phenotype. Eighty percent of the remaining mutations showed reduced thermostability, the exceptions being the two later-onset mutations which exhibited increased thermostability. Comparison of CSG with RSI detected a highly significant correlation (r(2) = 0.74, P = 0.002).

10525657,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations of the glucokinase gene cause hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. A quantitative understanding of these defects of glucose homeostasis linked to the glucokinase gene was lacking. Therefore a database of kinetic variables of wild-type and 20 missense mutants of glucokinase was developed and used in mathematical modelling to predict the thresholds for glucose-stimulated insulin release.
METHODS: Recombinant human glucokinase was generated in E. coli. The k(cat), glucose S(0.5), ATP K(m), and Hill number of glucokinase were determined. Inhibition by Stearoyl CoA and glucokinase regulatory protein and thermal stability were assayed for all mutants kinetically similar to wild-type glucokinase. A mathematical model predicting the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was constructed. This model is based on the two substrate kinetics of glucokinase and the kinetic variables of the database. It is assumed that both glucokinase gene alleles are equally expressed in beta-cells and that induction of glucokinase occurs as a function of basal blood glucose.
RESULTS: Large changes, varying greatly between mutants were found in nearly all variables. Glucokinase flux at threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was about 25 % of total phosphorylating potential in the normal beta-cell and this was used to predict thresholds for the mutant heterozygotes. Clinical data for maturity onset diabetes of the young type linked to the glucokinase gene and familial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia linked to the glucokinase gene and the glucokinase kinetic data of this study were used to test the model. The model predicts fasting blood glucose between 3 and 7 mmol/l in these cases.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: A kinetics database of wild-type and 20 mutants of glucokinase was developed. Many kinetic differences were found for the mutants.

23485969,"The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α; also known as NR2A1) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, which have conserved DNA-binding domains and ligand-binding domains. HNF-4α is the most abundant DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40% of the actively transcribed genes have a HNF-4α response element. These regulated genes are largely involved in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism. In the pancreas HNF-4α is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11% of islet genes. HNF-4α protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1 (MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Previous structural analyses of NRs, although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we describe the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4α homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. A convergence zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining domain-domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4α homodimer is different from that of the PPAR-γ-RXR-α heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are assembled on the same DNA element.

29704611,"Glucokinase (GCK) plays a key role in glucose homeostasis. Heterozygous inactivating mutations in the GCK gene cause the familial, mild fasting hyperglycaemia named MODY2. Besides its particular kinetic characteristics, glucokinase is regulated by subcellular compartmentation in hepatocytes. Glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) binds to GCK, leading to enzyme inhibition and import into the nucleus at fasting. When glucose concentration increases, GCK-GKRP dissociates and GCK is exported to the cytosol due to a nuclear export signal (NES). With the aim to characterize the GCK-NES, we have functionally analysed nine MODY2 mutations located within the NES sequence. Recombinant GCK mutants showed reduced catalytic activity and, in most cases, protein instability. Most of the mutants interact normally with GKRP, although mutations L306R and L309P impair GCK nuclear import in cotransfected cells. We demonstrated that GCK-NES function depends on exportin 1. We further showed that none of the mutations fully inactivate the NES, with the exception of mutation L304P, which likely destabilizes its α-helicoidal structure. Finally, we found that residue Glu300 negatively modulates the NES activity, whereas other residues have the opposite effect, thus suggesting that some of the NES spacer residues contribute to the low affinity of the NES for exportin 1, which is required for its proper functioning. In conclusion, our results have provided functional and structural insights regarding the GCK-NES and contributed to a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of glucokinase.

Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) and insulinogenic and disposition indexes were calculated.

15677479,"Glucokinase (GCK) serves as the pancreatic glucose sensor. Heterozygous inactivating GCK mutations cause hyperglycemia, whereas activating mutations cause hypoglycemia. We studied the GCK V62M mutation identified in two families and co-segregating with hyperglycemia to understand how this mutation resulted in reduced function. Structural modeling locates the mutation close to five naturally occurring activating mutations in the allosteric activator site of the enzyme. Recombinant glutathionyl S-transferase-V62M GCK is paradoxically activated rather than inactivated due to a decreased S0.5 for glucose compared with wild type (4.88 versus 7.55 mM). The recently described pharmacological activator (RO0281675) interacts with GCK at this site. V62M GCK does not respond to RO0281675, nor does it respond to the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). The enzyme is also thermally unstable, but this lability is apparently less pronounced than in the proven instability mutant E300K. Functional and structural analysis of seven amino acid substitutions at residue Val62 has identified a non-linear relationship between activation by the pharmacological activator and the van der Waals interactions energies. Smaller energies allow a hydrophobic interaction between the activator and glucokinase, whereas larger energies prohibit the ligand from fitting into the binding pocket. We conclude that V62M may cause hyperglycemia by a complex defect of GCK regulation involving instability in combination with loss of control by a putative endogenous activator and/or GKRP. This study illustrates that mutations that cause hyperglycemia are not necessarily kinetically inactivating but may exert their effects by other complex mechanisms.

We aimed to develop a robust approach for determining the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY and to obtain an accurate estimate of the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY in paediatric cases of diabetes.
METHODS: We extended our previous screening of the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry by 830 additional samples and comprehensively genotyped HNF1A variants in autoantibody-negative participants using next-generation sequencing. Carriers of pathogenic variants were treated by local healthcare providers, and participants with novel likely pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance were enrolled in an investigator-initiated, non-randomised, open-label pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT04239586). To identify variants associated with HNF1A-MODY, we functionally characterised their pathogenicity and assessed the carriers' phenotype and treatment response to sulfonylurea.
RESULTS: In total, 615 autoantibody-negative participants among 4712 cases of paediatric diabetes underwent genetic sequencing, revealing 19 with HNF1A variants. We identified nine carriers with novel variants classified as variants of uncertain significance or likely to be pathogenic, while the remaining ten participants carried five pathogenic variants previously reported. Of the nine carriers with novel variants, six responded favourably to sulfonylurea. Functional investigations revealed their variants to be dysfunctional and demonstrated a correlation with the resulting phenotype, providing evidence for reclassifying these variants as pathogenic.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on this robust classification, we estimate that the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY is 0.3% in paediatric diabetes.

KO platelets failed to bind the activation-independent ligand-mimetic mAb OP-G2 and did not bind fibrinogen or the activation-dependent ligand-mimetic mAb PAC-1 following activation of alphaIIb beta3 under any condition examined.

RESULTS: Genome sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed a C-to-A transversion in exon 6 that resulted in a p.Pro439Thr mutation of AT, which was previously reported as a pleiotropic effect type II AT deficiency (AT Budapest5).

METHODS: Here, we evaluated the performance of the mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based functional assay on an extensive set of BRCA2 missense variants.
RESULTS: Whereas all 20 nonpathogenic (class 1/2) variants were able to complement the cell lethal phenotype induced by loss of endogenous mouse Brca2, only 1 out of 15 pathogenic (class 4/5) variants (p.Gly2609Asp) was able to do so.

We evaluated 252 missense VUSs from the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain by using a homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) assay and identified 90 as non-functional and 162 as functional. The functional assay results were integrated with other available data sources into an ACMG/AMP rules-based classification framework used by a hereditary cancer testing laboratory. Of the 186 missense variants observed by the testing laboratory, 154 were classified as VUSs without functional data. However, after applying protein functional data, 86% (132/154) of the VUSs were reclassified as either likely pathogenic/pathogenic (39/132) or likely benign/benign (93/132), which impacted testing results for 1,900 individuals.

33293522,"Sequencing-based genetic tests to identify individuals at increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers have resulted in the identification of more than 40,000 sequence variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2. A majority of these variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS) because their impact on disease risk remains unknown, largely due to lack of sufficient familial linkage and epidemiological data. Several assays have been developed to examine the effect of VUS on protein function, which can be used to assess their impact on cancer susceptibility. In this study, we report the functional characterization of 88 BRCA2 variants, including several previously uncharacterized variants, using a well-established mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based assay. We have examined their ability to rescue the lethality of Brca2 null mESC as well as sensitivity to six DNA damaging agents including ionizing radiation and a PARP inhibitor. We have also examined the impact of BRCA2 variants on splicing. In addition, we have developed a computational model to determine the probability of impact on function of the variants that can be used for risk assessment. In contrast to the previous VarCall models that are based on a single functional assay, we have developed a new platform to analyze the data from multiple functional assays separately and in combination.

38709234,"PURPOSE: The emergence of large real-world clinical databases and tools to mine electronic medical records has allowed for an unprecedented look at large data sets with clinical and epidemiologic correlates. In clinical cancer genetics, real-world databases allow for the investigation of prevalence and effectiveness of prevention strategies and targeted treatments and for the identification of barriers to better outcomes. However, real-world data sets have inherent biases and problems (eg, selection bias, incomplete data, measurement error) that may hamper adequate analysis and affect statistical power.
METHODS: Here, we leverage a real-world clinical data set from a large health network for patients with breast cancer tested for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (N = 12,423). We conducted data cleaning and harmonization, cross-referenced with publicly available databases, performed variant reassessment and functional assays, and used functional data to inform a variant's clinical significance applying American College of Medical Geneticists and the Association of Molecular Pathology guidelines.
RESULTS: In the cohort, White and Black patients were over-represented, whereas non-White Hispanic and Asian patients were under-represented. Incorrect or missing variant designations were the most significant contributor to data loss. While manual curation corrected many incorrect designations, a sizable fraction of patient carriers remained with incorrect or missing variant designations. Despite the large number of patients with clinical significance not reported, original reported clinical significance assessments were accurate. Reassessment of variants in which clinical significance was not reported led to a marked improvement in data quality.

Genetic testing for sequence changes in BRCA1 frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on cancer risk and on the molecular function of BRCA1 is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for the homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a critical activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here, we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay for concurrently measuring the effects of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 for their role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we characterized the effects of 1,056 amino acid substitutions in the first 192 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects on DNA repair function or on cancer predisposition, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants.

However, an association with increased risk is unclear for a large fraction of BRCA1 variants present in the human population. Most of these variants of uncertain clinical significance lead to amino acid changes in the BRCA1 protein. Functional assays are valuable tools to assess the potential pathogenicity of these variants. Here, we systematically probed the effects of substitutions in the C terminus of BRCA1: the N- and C-terminal borders of its tandem BRCT domain, the BRCT-[N-C] linker region, and the α1 and α'1 helices in BRCT-[N] and -[C]. Using a validated transcriptional assay based on a fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the BRCA1 C terminus (amino acids 1396-1863), we assessed the functional impact of 99 missense variants of BRCA1. We include the data obtained for these 99 missense variants in a joint analysis to generate the likelihood of pathogenicity for 347 missense variants in BRCA1 using VarCall, a Bayesian integrative statistical model. The results from this analysis increase our understanding of BRCA1 regions less tolerant to changes, identify functional borders of structural domains, and predict the likelihood of pathogenicity for 98% of all BRCA1 missense variants in this region recorded in the population.

The analysis of additional germline-associated PTEN N-terminal variants illustrated the existence of a PTEN N-terminal region whose targeting in disease causes PTEN nuclear accumulation, in parallel with defects in PIP3-catalytic activity in cells.

RESULTS: Eighty-five variants (33%) were associated with abnormal splicing. The most frequent abnormality was upstream exon skipping (39/85 variants), which was most often associated with splice donor region variants. SpliceAI had greatest accuracy in predicting splicing abnormalities (0.91) and outperformed other tools in sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Splicing analysis of blood RNA identifies diagnostically important splicing abnormalities and clarifies functional effects of a significant proportion of VUSs.

Eleven missense variations in the RPE65 gene were evaluated in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) using the EPP algorithm. The accuracy of the EPP algorithm was evaluated using a cell-culture assay of RPE65-isomerase activity The variations were engineered into plasmids containing a human RPE65 cDNA and the retinoid isomerase activity of each variant was determined in cultured cells. The EPP algorithm predicted eight substitution mutations to be disease-causing variants. The isomerase catalytic activities of these RPE65 variants were all less than 6% of wild-type. In contrast, the EPP algorithm predicted the other three substitutions to be non-disease-causing, with isomerase activities of 68%, 127%, and 110% of wild-type, respectively. We observed complete concordance between the predicted pathogenicities of missense variations in the RPE65 gene and retinoid isomerase activities measured in a functional assay.

16150724,"RPE65 is essential for isomerization of vitamin A to the visual chromophore. Mutations in RPE65 cause early-onset blindness, and Rpe65-deficient mice lack 11-cis-retinal but overaccumulate alltrans-retinyl esters in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RPE65 is proposed to be a substrate chaperone but may have an enzymatic role because it is closely related to carotenoid oxygenases. We hypothesize that, by analogy with other carotenoid oxygenases, the predicted iron-coordinating residues of RPE65 are essential for retinoid isomerization. To clarify RPE65's role in isomerization, we reconstituted a robust minimal visual cycle in 293-F cells. Only cells transfected with RPE65 constructs produced 11-cis-retinoids, but coexpression with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase was needed for high-level production. Accumulation was significant, amounting to >2 nmol of 11-cis-retinol per culture. Transfection with constructs harboring mutations in residues of RPE65 homologous to those required for interlinked enzymatic activity and iron coordination in related enzymes abolish this isomerization. Iron chelation also abolished isomerization activity. Mutating cysteines implicated in palmitoylation of RPE65 had generally little effect on isomerization activity. Mutations associated with Leber congenital amaurosis/early-onset blindness cause partial to total loss of isomerization activity in direct relation to their clinical effects.

METHODS: Abelson virus-transformed Rag2-/- pro-B cells engineered to contain an inverted green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette flanked by recombination signal sequences were transduced with retroviruses encoding either wild-type or 41 naturally occurring RAG2 variants. Bicistronic vectors were used to introduce compound heterozygous RAG2 variants. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells was evaluated by using flow cytometry, and high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze rearrangements at the endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus.
RESULTS: The RAG2 variants showed a wide range of recombination activity. Mutations associated with severe combined immunodeficiency and Omenn syndrome had significantly lower activity than those detected in patients with less severe clinical presentations. Four variants (P253R, F386L, N474S, and M502V) previously thought to be pathogenic were found to have wild-type levels of activity.

Patients with ARTEMIS deficiency usually present with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and cellular radiosensitivity, but hypomorphic mutations can cause milder phenotypes (leaky SCID).
OBJECTIVE: We sought to correlate the functional effect of human DCLRE1C mutations on phenotypic presentation in patients with ARTEMIS deficiency.
METHODS: We studied the recombination and DNA repair activity of 41 human DCLRE1C mutations in Dclre1c(-/-) v-abl kinase-transformed pro-B cells retrovirally engineered with a construct that allows quantification of recombination activity by means of flow cytometry. For assessment of DNA repair efficacy, resolution of γH2AX accumulation was studied after ionizing radiation.
RESULTS: Low or absent activity was detected for mutations causing a typical SCID phenotype. Most of the patients with leaky SCID were compound heterozygous for 1 loss-of-function and 1 hypomorphic allele, with significant residual levels of recombination and DNA repair activity. Deletions disrupting the C-terminus result in truncated but partially functional proteins and are often associated with leaky SCID. Overexpression of hypomorphic mutants might improve the functional defect.
CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between the nature and location of DCLRE1C mutations, functional activity, and the clinical phenotype has been observed.

30885608,"Diseases arising from misfolding of SLC6 transporters have been reported over recent years, e.g. folding-deficient mutants of the dopamine transporter and of the glycine transporter-2 cause infantile/juvenile Parkinsonism dystonia and hyperekplexia, respectively. Mutations in the coding sequence of the human creatine transporter-1 (hCRT-1/SLC6A8) gene result in a creatine transporter deficiency syndrome, which varies in its clinical manifestation from epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, development delay and motor dysfunction to gastrointestinal symptoms. Some of the mutations in hCRT-1 occur at residues, which are highly conserved across the SLC6 family. Here, we examined 16 clinically relevant hCRT-1 variants to verify the conjecture that they were misfolded and that this folding defect was amenable to correction. Confocal microscopy imaging revealed that the heterologously expressed YFP-tagged mutant CRTs were trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), co-localised with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin. In contrast, the wild type hCRT-1 reached the plasma membrane. Preincubation of transiently transfected HEK293 cells with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) restored ER export and surface expression of as well as substrate uptake by several folding-deficient CRT-1 mutants. A representative mutant (hCRT-1-P544L) was expressed in rat primary hippocampal neurons to verify pharmacochaperoning in a target cell: 4-PBA promoted the delivery of hCRT-1-P544L to the neurite extensions. These observations show that several folding-deficient hCRT-1 mutants can be rescued. This proof-of-principle justifies the search for additional pharmacochaperones to restore folding of 4PBA-unresponsive hCRT-1 mutants.

Here we show that the 26 S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (PSMD13), a newly identified negative regulator of RPE65, plays a critical role in regulating pathogenicity of three mutations (L22P, T101I, and L408P) by mediating rapid degradation of mutated RPE65s via a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent non-lysosomal pathway. These mutant RPE65s were misfolded and formed aggregates or high molecular complexes via disulfide bonds. Interaction of PSMD13 with mutant RPE65s promoted degradation of misfolded but not properly folded mutant RPE65s. Many mutations, including L22P, T101I, and L408P, were mapped on non-active sites. Although their activities were very low, these mutant RPE65s were catalytically active and could be significantly rescued at low temperature, whereas mutant RPE65s with a distinct active site mutation could not be rescued under the same conditions. Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and glycerol displayed a significant synergistic effect on the low temperature rescue of the mutant RPE65s by promoting proper folding, reducing aggregation, and increasing membrane association. Our results suggest that a low temperature eye mask and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved oral medicine, may provide a promising ""protein repair therapy"" that can enhance the efficacy of gene therapy by reducing the cytotoxic effect of misfolded mutant RPE65s.",PS3_supporting,NM_000329.3:c.715T>G,"The variant exhibited between 1% (PMID: 24849605) and 5% (PMID: 19431183) enzymatic activity in retinoid isomerase assays relative to the wild-type control, which is lower than the ClinGen LCA / eoRD PS3_Supporting threshold of <10% activity, indicating that it triggers a severe defect in protein function.",,1,"Gene: RPE65, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr1_68439571_A_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr1_68905254_A_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.68439571A>C, HGVSg (hg37): g.68905254A>C, rsID: rs61752896, HGVSc: c.715T>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Tyr239Asp, HGVSp (1-letter): p.Y239D"
18599565,"PURPOSE: Later onset and progression of retinal dystrophy occur with some RPE65 missense mutations. The functional consequences of the novel P25L RPE65 mutation was correlated with its early-childhood phenotype and compared with other pathogenic missense mutations.
METHODS: In addition to typical clinical tests, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and two-color threshold perimetry (2CTP) were measured. RPE65 mutations were screened by SSCP and direct sequencing. Isomerase activity of mutant RPE65 was assayed in 293F cells and quantified by HPLC analysis of retinoids.
RESULTS: A very mild phenotype was detected in a now 7-year-old boy homozygous for the P25L mutation in RPE65. Although abnormal dark adaptation was noticed early, best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 at age 5 years and 20/30 at age 7 years. Nystagmus was absent. Cone electroretinogram (ERG) was measurable, rod ERG severely reduced, and FAF very low. 2CTP detected mainly cone-mediated responses in scotopic conditions, and light-adapted cone responses were approximately 1.5 log units below normal. High-resolution spectral domain OCT revealed morphologic changes. Isomerase activity in 293F cells transfected with RPE65/P25L was reduced to 7.7% of wild-type RPE65-transfected cells, whereas RPE65/L22P-transfected cells had 13.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The mild clinical phenotype observed is consistent with the residual activity of a severely hypomorphic mutant RPE65. Reduction to <10% of wild-type RPE65 activity by homozygous P25L correlates with almost complete rod function loss and cone amplitude reduction.

OBJECTIVES:  We investigated the antithrombin p.Thr147Ala variant, found in 12 patients of African origin. This variant is known as rs2227606 with minor allele frequency of 0.5% in Africans and absent in Europeans. A possible founder effect was investigated.
METHODS:  Phenotypical characterization was established through immunological and functional methods, both under basal and stress conditions. Recombinant antithrombin molecules were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in HEK-293T cells. Secreted antithrombin was purified and functionally characterized. Structural modeling was performed to predict the impact of the mutation on protein structure. A novel nanopore sequencing approach was used for haplotype investigation.
RESULTS: Ten patients experienced VTE, stroke, or obstetric complications. Antithrombin antigen levels and anti-IIa activity were normal or slightly reduced while anti-Xa activity was reduced with only one commercial assay. On crossed immunoelectrophoresis, an increase of antithrombin fractions with reduced heparin affinity was observed under high ionic strength conditions but not under physiological conditions. The recombinant p.Thr147Ala protein displayed a reduced anti-Xa activity. Structural modeling revealed that residue Thr147 forms three hydrogen bonds that are abolished when mutated to alanine. The investigated patients shared a common haplotype involving 13 SERPINC1 intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms.

25752820,"RPE65 is a membrane-associated retinoid isomerase involved in the visual cycle responsible for sustaining vision. Many mutations in the human RPE65 gene are associated with distinct forms of retinal degenerative diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms for most of these mutations remain poorly understood.

The mutations are mapped on non-active sites but severely reduced isomerase activity of RPE65. At 30°C, however, the enzymatic function and membrane-association of the mutant RPE65s are significantly rescued possibly due to proper folding. In addition, PSMD13 displayed a drastically decreased effect on degradation of the mutant proteins in the cells grown at 30°C.

22291974,"Glucokinase (GK) acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta-cell and regulates insulin secretion. Heterozygous mutations in the human GK-encoding GCK gene that reduce the activity index increase the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion threshold and cause familial, mild fasting hyperglycaemia, also known as Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 2 (MODY2). Here we describe the biochemical characterization of five missense GK mutations: p.Ile130Thr, p.Asp205His, p.Gly223Ser, p.His416Arg and p.Ala449Thr. The enzymatic analysis of the corresponding bacterially expressed GST-GK mutant proteins show that all of them impair the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme. In keeping with their position within the protein, mutations p.Ile130Thr, p.Asp205His, p.Gly223Ser, and p.His416Arg strongly decrease the activity index of GK, affecting to one or more kinetic parameters. In contrast, the p.Ala449Thr mutation, which is located in the allosteric activator site, does not affect significantly the activity index of GK, but dramatically modifies the main kinetic parameters responsible for the function of this enzyme as a glucose sensor. The reduced Kcat of the mutant (3.21±0.28 s(-1) vs 47.86±2.78 s(-1)) is balanced by an increased glucose affinity (S(0.5) = 1.33±0.08 mM vs 7.86±0.09 mM) and loss of cooperativity for this substrate. We further studied the mechanism by which this mutation impaired GK kinetics by measuring the differential effects of several competitive inhibitors and one allosteric activator on the mutant protein.

Germline pathogenic variants in DICER1 cause this condition. Detecting a variant of uncertain significance in DICER1 or finding uncommon phenotypes complicate the diagnosis and can negatively impact patient care. We present two unrelated patients suspected to have DICER1 syndrome. Both females (aged 13 and 15 years) presented with multinodular goiter (thyroid follicular nodular disease) and ovarian tumours. One was diagnosed with an ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT) and the other, with an ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumour, later reclassified as a retiform variant of SLCT. Genetic screening showed no germline pathogenic variants in DICER1. However, two potentially splicing variants were found, DICER1 c.5365-4A>G and c.5527+3A>G. Also, typical somatic DICER1 RNase IIIb hotspot mutations were detected in the thyroid and ovarian tissues. In silico splicing algorithms predicted altered splicing for both germline variants and skipping of exon 25 was confirmed by RNA assays for both variants.

Despite its importance, the mechanism that mediates membrane localization of PTEN is poorly understood. Here, we generated a library that contains green fluorescent protein fused to randomly mutated human PTEN and expressed the library in Dictyostelium cells. Using live cell imaging, we identified mutations that enhance the association of PTEN with the plasma membrane. These mutations were located in four separate regions, including the phosphatase catalytic site, the calcium-binding region 3 (CBR3) loop, the Cα2 loop and the C-terminal tail phosphorylation site. The phosphatase catalytic site, the CBR3 loop and the Cα2 loop formed the membrane-binding regulatory interface and interacted with the inhibitory phosphorylated C-terminal tail.

16690726,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder present in 1 in 8000 people and associated with arteriovenous malformations. Genetic testing can identify individuals at risk of developing the disease and is a useful diagnostic tool.
OBJECTIVE: To present a strategy for mutation detection in families clinically diagnosed with HHT.
METHODS: An optimised strategy for detecting mutations that predispose to HHT is presented. The strategy includes quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction, sequence analysis, RNA analysis, validation of missense mutations by amino acid conservation analysis for the ENG (endoglin) and ACVRL1 (ALK1) genes, and analysis of an ACVRL1 protein structural model. If no causative ENG or ACVRL1 mutation is found, proband samples are referred for sequence analysis of MADH4 (associated with a combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT).
RESULTS: Data obtained over the past eight years were summarised and 16 novel mutations described. Mutations were identified in 155 of 194 families with a confirmed clinical diagnosis (80% sensitivity). Of 155 mutations identified, 94 were in ENG (61%), 58 in ACVRL1 (37%), and three in MADH4 (2%).
CONCLUSIONS: For most missense variants of ENG and ACVRL1 reported to date, study of amino acid conservation showed good concordance between prediction of altered protein function and disease occurrence.

22022569,"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition affecting the vascular system and is characterised by epistaxis, arteriovenous malformations and mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases. This disorder affects approximately 1 in 8,000 people worldwide. Significant morbidity is associated with this condition in affected individuals, and anaemia can be a consequence of repeated haemorrhages from telangiectasia in the gut and nose. In the majority of the cases reported, the condition is caused by mutations in either ACVRL1 or endoglin genes, which encode components of the TGF-beta signalling pathway. Numerous missense mutations in endoglin have been reported as causative defects for HHT but the exact underlying cellular mechanisms caused by these mutations have not been fully established despite data supporting a role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery. For this reason, we examined the subcellular trafficking of twenty-five endoglin disease-causing missense mutations. The mutant proteins were expressed in HeLa and HEK293 cell lines, and their subcellular localizations were established by confocal fluorescence microscopy alongside the analysis of their N-glycosylation profiles. ER quality control was found to be responsible in eight (L32R, V49F, C53R, V125D, A160D, P165L, I271N and A308D) out of eleven mutants located on the orphan extracellular domain in addition to two (C363Y and C382W) out of thirteen mutants in the Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain. In addition, a single intracellular domain missense mutant was examined and found to traffic predominantly to the plasma membrane. These findings support the notion of the involvement of the ER's quality control in the mechanism of a significant number, but not all, missense endoglin mutants found in HHT type 1 patients.

22192717,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disorder characterized by epistaxis, arteriovenous malformations, and telangiectases. The majority of the patients have a mutation in the coding region of the activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) or Endoglin (ENG) gene. However, in approximately 15% of cases, sequencing analysis and deletion/duplication testing fail to identify mutations in the coding regions of these genes. Knowing its vital role in transcription and translation control, we were prompted to investigate the 5'untranslated region (UTR) of ENG.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced the 5'UTR of ENG for 154 HHT patients without mutations in ENG or ACVRL1 coding regions. We found a mutation (c.-127C > T), which is predicted to affect translation initiation and alter the reading frame of endoglin. This mutation was found in a family with linkage to the ENG, as well as in three other patients, one of which had an affected sibling with the same mutation. In vitro expression studies showed that a construct with the c.-127C > T mutation alters the translation and decreases the level of the endoglin protein. In addition, a c.-9G > A mutation was found in three patients, one of whom was homozygous for this mutation. Expression studies showed decreased protein levels suggesting that the c.-9G > A is a hypomorphic mutation.

22116359,"BACKGROUND: Pendrin is a multifunctional anion transporter that exchanges chloride and iodide in the thyroid, as well as chloride and bicarbonate in the inner ear, kidney and airways. Loss or reduction in the function of pendrin results in both syndromic (Pendred syndrome) and non-syndromic (non-syndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (ns-EVA)) hearing loss. Factors inducing an up-regulation of pendrin in the kidney and the lung may have an impact on the pathogenesis of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Here we characterize the ion transport activity of wild-type (WT) pendrin and seven of its allelic variants selected among those reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms data base (dbSNPs), some of which were previously identified in a cohort of individuals with normal hearing or deaf patients belonging to the Spanish population.
METHODS: WT and mutated pendrin allelic variants were functionally characterized in a heterologous over-expression system by means of fluorometric methods evaluating the I(-)/Cl(-) and Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange and an assay evaluating the efflux of radiolabeled iodide.
RESULTS: The transport activity of pendrin P70L, P301L and F667C is completely abolished; pendrin V609G and D687Y allelic variants are functionally impaired but retain significant transport.

Also, Phe-418 sits at the neck of the cleft, lending a bend to the volume enclosed by the cleft. All mutations of Phe-61, Phe-312, and Phe-418 result in severely impaired or inactive enzyme. However, mutation of Phe-526 and Tyr-338, like Phe-103, decreases 11-cis-retinol formation, whereas increasing the 13-cis isomer. Significantly, 2 of these 3 residues, Phe-103 and Tyr-338, are located on putatively mobile interstrand loops. We propose that residual densities located in the binding cleft of the RPE65 structure represents a post-cleavage snapshot consistent not only with a fatty acid product, as originally modeled, but also an 11-cis-retinol product. Substrate docking simulations permit 11-cis- or 13-cis-retinyl ester binding in this relatively closed cleft, with the latter favored in F103L, F526A, and Y338A mutant structures, but prohibit binding of all-trans-retinyl ester, suggesting that isomerization occurs early in the temporal sequence, with O-alkyl ester cleavage occurring later.

To determine the biological activities of these mutants, we performed functional assays testing their abilities to transduce BMP signals. We found that the reported missense mutations within the extracellular and kinase domains of BMPR-II abrogated their signal-transducing abilities. BMPR-II proteins containing mutations at the conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular and kinase domains were detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the loss of signaling ability of certain BMPR-II mutants is due at least in part to their altered subcellular localization.

RESULTS: The phenotypes of c.4712T>C(p. I1571T), c.2995G>A(p.E999K), and c.4015A>G(p. N1339D) variants showed similar characteristics, including early seizure onset with severe to profound intellectual disability. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of the activation curve and smaller recovery time constants of fast-inactivation than in wild type, indicating a prominent gain of function (GOF).

29466837,"OBJECTIVE: Voltage-gated sodium (Na+ ) channels underlie action potential generation and propagation and hence are central to the regulation of excitability in the nervous system. Mutations in the genes SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN8A, encoding the Na+ channel pore-forming (α) subunits Nav1.1, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively, and SCN1B, encoding the accessory subunit β<sub>1</sub> , are established causes of genetic epilepsies. SCN3A, encoding Nav1.3, is known to be highly expressed in brain, but has not previously been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we describe a cohort of 4 patients with epileptic encephalopathy and heterozygous de novo missense variants in SCN3A (p.Ile875Thr in 2 cases, p.Pro1333Leu, and p.Val1769Ala).
METHODS: All patients presented with treatment-resistant epilepsy in the first year of life, severe to profound intellectual disability, and in 2 cases (both with the variant p.Ile875Thr), diffuse polymicrogyria.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological recordings of mutant channels revealed prominent gain of channel function, with a markedly increased amplitude of the slowly inactivating current component, and for 2 of 3 mutants (p.Ile875Thr and p.Pro1333Leu), a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Gain of function was not observed for Nav1.3 variants known or presumed to be inherited (p.Arg1642Cys and p.Lys1799Gln). The antiseizure medications phenytoin and lacosamide selectively blocked slowly inactivating over transient current in wild-type and mutant Nav1.3 channels.
INTERPRETATION: These findings establish SCN3A as a new gene for infantile epileptic encephalopathy and suggest a potential pharmacologic intervention. These findings also reinforce the role of Nav1.3 as an important regulator of neuronal excitability in the developing brain, while providing additional insight into mechanisms of slow inactivation of Nav1.3.

Objective: We aim to estimate the incidence, clinical presentation, genetic variability, and treatment outcome with geographic distribution of patients with the RAG defects in populations inhabiting South, West, and East Slavic countries. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from RAG-deficient patients of Slavic origin via chart review, retrospectively. Recombinase activity was determined in vitro by flow cytometry-based assay. Results: Based on the clinical and immunologic phenotype, our cohort of 82 patients from 68 families represented a wide spectrum of RAG deficiencies, including SCID (n = 20), OS (n = 37), and LS/CID (n = 25) phenotypes. Sixty-seven (81.7%) patients carried RAG1 and 15 patients (18.3%) carried RAG2 biallelic variants. We estimate that the minimal annual incidence of RAG deficiency in Slavic countries varies between 1 in 180,000 and 1 in 300,000 live births, and it may vary secondary to health care disparities in these regions. In our cohort, 70% (n = 47) of patients with RAG1 variants carried p.K86Vfs*33 (c.256_257delAA) allele, either in homozygous (n = 18, 27%) or in compound heterozygous (n = 29, 43%) form. The majority (77%) of patients with homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 variant originated from Vistula watershed area in Central and Eastern Poland, and compound heterozygote cases were distributed among all Slavic countries except Bulgaria. Clinical and immunological presentation of homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 cases was highly diverse (SCID, OS, and AS/CID) suggestive of strong influence of additional genetic and/or epigenetic factors in shaping the final phenotype. Conclusion: We propose that RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 is a founder variant originating from the Vistula watershed region in Poland, which may explain a high proportion of homozygous cases from Central and Eastern Poland and the presence of the variant in all Slavs. Our studies in this cohort of RAG1 founder variants confirm that clinical and immunological phenotypes only partially depend on the underlying genetic defect.

15611064,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product, pVHL, targets the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-alpha) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This tumor suppressor function is mediated by the alpha- and beta-domains responsible for assembling the pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and for recognizing the prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-alpha, respectively. The molecular basis for a large number of tumor-derived mutations can be attributed to alterations that directly compromise the ability of pVHL to assemble the E3 or to contact the substrate. Here we describe a new mechanism of oncogenic inactivation by VHL missense mutations that lie in the L1 and L7 linker regions distal to the HIF-alpha-binding pocket. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tumorigenic L1 loop mutation of Ser(65) to Leu, deficient in promoting the degradation of HIF-alpha, disrupts the coordination of internal motions of the pVHL.HIF-1alpha complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to S65L, five other tumor-derived VHL mutations located within the L1 loop are each defective in mediating proteolysis of HIF-2alpha. Moreover, dynamic organization of pVHL.HIF-1alpha recognition is focally centered on Gln(145) within the L7 loop, and its tumorigenic mutant Q145H abolishes almost all of the correlated dynamic motions. Intriguingly, Q145H, whereas defective in targeting cellular HIF-alpha for degradation, had an attenuated hydroxylation dependence in binding to HIF-1alpha in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that specific association between pVHL and the hydroxylated HIF-alpha requires both the L1 and L7 loops to coordinate dynamic coupling among distant pVHL regions, whose mutational disruption inactivates VHL and is hence responsible for tumorigenesis.",PS3_supporting,NM_000551.4:c.194C>G,"S65W significantly decreases the VHL protein binding to HIF-1alpha, preventing ubiquitination.",,1,"Gene: VHL, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr3_10142041_C_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr3_10183725_C_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.10142041C>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.10183725C>G, rsID: rs5030826, HGVSc: c.194C>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Ser65Trp, HGVSp (1-letter): p.S65W"

In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis in a ccRCC dataset showing an association of RSUME levels with VHL mutations and tumor progression, and we demonstrate the molecular mechanism by which RSUME regulates the pathologic angiogenic phenotype of VHL missense mutations. We report that VHL mutants fail to downregulate RSUME protein levels accounting for the increased RSUME expression found in RCC tumors. Furthermore, we prove that targeting RSUME in RCC cell line clones carrying missense VHL mutants results in decreased early tumor angiogenesis. The mechanism we describe is that RSUME sumoylates VHL mutants and beyond its sumoylation capacity, interacts with Type 2 VHL mutants, reduces HIF-2α-VHL mutants binding, and negatively regulates the assembly of the Type 2 VHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV) complex.

12944410,"Bi-allelic-inactivating mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene are found in the majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (VHL(-/-) RCC). VHL(-/-) RCC cells overproduce hypoxia-inducible genes as a consequence of constitutive, oxygen-independent activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). While HIF activation explains the highly vascularized nature of VHL loss lesions, the relative role of HIF in oncogenesis and loss of growth control remains unknown. Here, we report that HIF plays a central role in promoting unregulated growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells by activating the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway. Dominant-negative HIF and enzymatic inhibition of EGF-R were equally efficient at abolishing EGF-R activation and serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. TGF-alpha is the only known EGF-R ligand that has a VHL-dependent expression profile and its overexpression by VHL(-/-) RCC cells is a direct consequence of HIF activation. In contrast to TGF-alpha, other HIF targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were unable to stimulate serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. VHL(-/-) RCC cells expressing reintroduced type 2C mutants of VHL, and which retain the ability to degrade HIF, fail to overproduce TGF-alpha and proliferate in serum-free media. These data link HIF with the overproduction of a bona fide renal cell mitogen leading to activation of a pathway involved in growth of renal cancer cells.

19030229,"BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by a spectrum of hypervascular tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, which occur with VHL genotype-specific differences in penetrance. VHL loss causes a failure to regulate the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), resulting in accumulation of both factors to high levels. Although HIF dysregulation is critical to VHL disease-associated renal tumorigenesis, increasing evidence points toward gradations of HIF dysregulation contributing to the degree of predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other manifestations of the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This investigation examined the ability of disease-specific VHL missense mutations to support the assembly of the VBC complex and to promote the ubiquitylation of HIF. Our interaction analysis supported previous observations that VHL Type 2B mutations disrupt the interaction between pVHL and Elongin C but maintain partial regulation of HIF. We additionally demonstrated that Type 2B mutant pVHL forms a remnant VBC complex containing the active members ROC1 and Cullin-2 which retains the ability to ubiquitylate HIF-1alpha.

Whereas the development of hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinomas has been attributed to impaired HIF-1/2alpha down-regulation by pVHL mutant proteins, the molecular defects underlying the development of pheochromocytomas are still unknown. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of pVHL mutant proteins linked to type 2C (pheochromocytoma only) von Hippel-Lindau disease.

23772956,"BACKGROUND: In von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene cause clear cell renal carcinomas, hemangioblastomas, and pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene product is part of an ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) is a key substrate, although additional VHL functions have been described. A genotype-phenotype relationship exists in VHL disease such that specific VHL mutations elicit certain subsets of these tumors. Here, we examine VHL genotype-phenotype correlations at the cellular level, focusing on the regulation of tight junctions and cell morphology.
METHODS: Wild-type and various mutant VHL proteins representing VHL disease subtypes were stably expressed in 3 VHL-negative renal carcinoma cell lines. Using these cell lines, the roles of various VHL-associated cellular functions in regulation of cell morphology were investigated.
RESULTS: As a whole, type 1 mutants varied greatly from type 2 mutants, demonstrating high levels of HIF-2alpha, cyclin D1 and alpha5 integrin, lower p27 levels, and a spindly, fibroblastic cellular appearance. Type 2 mutations demonstrated an epithelial morphology similar to wild-type VHL in the majority of the renal cell lines used. Knockdown of p27 in cells with wild-type VHL led to perturbations of both epithelial morphology and ZO-1 localization to tight junctions. ZO-1 localization correlated well with VHL disease subtypes, with greater mislocalization observed for genotypes associated with a higher risk of renal carcinoma. HIF-2alpha knockdown in 786-O partially restored ZO-1 localization, but did not restore an epithelial morphology.

A key negative regulator of HIFα is von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein. Here we show that evolutionarily-relevant substitutions can modulate a secondary contact between HIF1α Met561 and VHL Phe91. Notably, HIF1α binds more tightly than HIF2α to VHL due to a conserved Met to Thr substitution observed in the vertebrate lineage. Similarly, substitution of VHL Phe91 with Tyr, as seen in invertebrate species, decreases VHL affinity for both HIF1α and HIF2α. We propose that vertebrate evolution involved a more complex hypoxia response with fine-tuned divergence of VHL affinity for HIF1α and HIF2α.",PS3_supporting,NM_000551.4:c.273C>A,"In Tarade et al, an in vitro pVHL-HIFa binding assay followed by immunoblotting showed the F91L variant abolished all binding to HIF1a and HIF2a.",,1,"Gene: VHL, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr3_10142120_C_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr3_10183804_C_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.10142120C>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.10183804C>A, rsID: rs1060503563, HGVSc: c.273C>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Phe91Leu, HGVSp (1-letter): p.F91L"
32766856,"Many mutations in the signal peptide and propeptide of factor IX (FIX) cause hemophilia B. A FIX variants database reports 28 unique missense mutations in these regions that lead to FIX deficiency, but the underlying mechanism is known only for the mutations on R43 that interfere with propeptide cleavage. It remains unclear how other mutations result in FIX deficiency and why patients carrying the same mutation have different bleeding tendencies. Here, we modify a cell-based reporter assay to characterize the missense mutations in the signal peptide and propeptide of FIX. The results show that the level of secreted conformation-specific reporter (SCSR), which has a functional γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domain of FIX, decreases significantly in most mutations. The decreased SCSR level is consistent with FIX deficiency in hemophilia B patients. Moreover, we find that the decrease in the SCSR level is caused by several distinct mechanisms, including interfering with cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, protein secretion, γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain, and cleavage of the signal peptide or propeptide. Importantly, our results also show that the SCSR levels of most signal peptide and propeptide mutations increase with vitamin K concentration, suggesting that the heterogeneity of bleeding tendencies may be related to vitamin K levels in the body.

In this report, we aim to investigate the case of a 39-year-old male patient with sensorineural deafness who presented to the eye clinic with nyctalopia, retinal pigmentary changes and bilateral cortical cataracts.
METHODS: The patient was examined clinically and investigated with autofluorescence, full-field electroretinography, electro-oculogram and dark adaptometry. Sequencing of the mitochondrial genome in blood and muscle tissue was followed by histochemical and biochemical analyses together with single fibre studies of a muscle biopsy to confirm a mitochondrial aetiology.
RESULTS: Electrophysiology, colour testing and dark adaptometry showed significant photoreceptor dysfunction with macular involvement. Sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome revealed a rare mitochondrial tRNALys (MTTK) gene variant-m.8340G&gt;A-which was heteroplasmic in blood (11%) and skeletal muscle (65%) and cosegregated with cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres in single-fibre studies.

37419334,"BACKGROUND: Thymus hypoplasia due to stromal cell problems has been linked to mutations in several transcription factors, including Forkhead box N1 (FOXN1). FOXN1 supports T-cell development by regulating the formation and expansion of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). While autosomal recessive FOXN1 mutations result in a nude and severe combined immunodeficiency phenotype, the impact of single-allelic or compound heterozygous FOXN1 mutations is less well-defined.
OBJECTIVE: With more than 400 FOXN1 mutations reported, their impact on protein function and thymopoiesis remains unclear for most variants. We developed a systematic approach to delineate the functional impact of diverse FOXN1 variants.
METHODS: Selected FOXN1 variants were tested with transcriptional reporter assays and imaging studies. Thymopoiesis was assessed in mouse lines genocopying several human FOXN1 variants. Reaggregate thymus organ cultures were used to compare the thymopoietic potential of the FOXN1 variants.
RESULTS: FOXN1 variants were categorized into benign, loss- or gain-of-function, and/or dominant-negatives. Dominant negative activities mapped to frameshift variants impacting the transactivation domain. A nuclear localization signal was mapped within the DNA binding domain. Thymopoiesis analyses with mouse models and reaggregate thymus organ cultures revealed distinct consequences of particular Foxn1 variants on T-cell development.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential effect of a FOXN1 variant on T-cell output from the thymus may relate to its effects on transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and/or dominant negative functions.

SUMMARY: Background Treatment of the bleeding disorder von Willebrand disease (VWD) focuses on increasing von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels by administration of desmopressin or VWF-containing concentrates. Both therapies leave the production of mutant VWF unhindered, which may have additional consequences, such as thrombocytopenia in patients with VWD type 2B, competition between mutant and normal VWF for platelet receptors, and the potential development of intestinal angiodysplasia. Most cases of VWD are caused by dominant-negative mutations in VWF, and we hypothesize that diminishing expression of mutant VWF positively affects VWD phenotypes. Objectives To investigate allele-specific inhibition of VWF by applying small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VWF. This approach allows allele-specific knockdown irrespective of the mutations causing VWD. Methods Four SNPs with a high predicted heterozygosity within VWF were selected, and siRNAs were designed against both alleles of the four SNPs. siRNA efficiency, allele specificity and siRNA-mediated phenotypic improvements were determined in VWF-expressing HEK293 cells. Results Twelve siRNAs were able to efficiently inhibit single VWF alleles in HEK293 cells that stably produce VWF. Transient cotransfections of these siRNAs with two VWF alleles resulted in a clear preference for the targeted allele over the untargeted allele for 11 siRNAs. We also demonstrated siRNA-mediated phenotypic improvement of the VWF multimerization pattern of the VWD type 2A mutation VWF p.Cys2773Ser.

SUMMARY: Background von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) circulate as a non-covalent complex, with VWF serving as the carrier for FVIII. VWF indirectly influences secondary hemostasis by stabilizing FVIII and transporting it to the site of primary hemostasis. Type 2N von Willebrand disease involves impaired binding of VWF to FVIII, resulting in decreased plasma levels of FVIII. Objectives In these studies, we characterize the impact of three type 2N VWD variants (R763A, R854Q, R816W) on VWF secretion, FVIII stabilization and thrombus formation in a murine model. Methods Type 2N VWD mice were generated by hydrodynamic injections of mutant murine VWF cDNAs and the influence of these variants on VWF secretion and FVIII binding was evaluated. In vivo hemostasis and the dynamics of thrombus formation and embolization were assessed using a murine tail vein transection hemostasis model and an intravital thrombosis model in the cremaster arterioles. Results Type 2N VWD variants were associated with decreased VWF secretion using cell and animal-based models.

We engineered the first knock-in (KI) murine model for VWD-type 2B by introducing the p.V1316M mutation in murine VWF. Homozygous KI-mice replicated human VWD-type 2B with macrothrombocytopenia (platelet counts reduced by 55%, platelet volume increased by 44%), circulating platelet-aggregates and a severe bleeding tendency. Also, vessel occlusion was deficient in the FeCl3-induced thrombosis model. Platelet aggregation induced by thrombin or collagen was defective for KI-mice at all doses. KI-mice manifested a loss of high molecular weight multimers and increased multimer degradation. In a model of VWF-string formation, the number of platelets/string and string-lifetime were surprisingly enhanced in KI-mice, suggesting that proteolysis of VWF/p.V1316M is differentially regulated in the circulation versus the endothelial surface. Furthermore, we observed increased leukocyte recruitment during an inflammatory response induced by the reverse passive Arthus reaction. This points to an active role of VWF/p.V1316M in the exfiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions.

29186156,"Rheological forces in the blood trigger the unfolding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its A2 domain, exposing the scissile bond for proteolysis by ADAMTS13. Under quiescent conditions, the scissile bond is hidden by the folded structure due to the stabilisation provided by the structural specialisations of the VWF A2 domain, a vicinal disulphide bond, a calcium binding site and a N1574-glycan.The reduced circulating high MW multimers of VWF in patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease (VWD) may be associated with mutations within the VWF A2 domain and this is attributed to enhanced ADAMTS13 proteolysis. We investigated 11 VWF A2 domain variants identified in patients with type 2A VWD. In recombinant full-length VWF, enhanced ADAMTS13 proteolysis was detected for all of the expressed variants in the presence of urea-induced denaturation. A subset of the FLVWF variants displayed enhanced proteolysis in the absence of urea. The mechanism of enhancement was investigated using a novel VWF A2 domain FRET construct. In the absence of induced unfolding, 7/8 of the expressed mutants exhibited a disrupted domain fold, causing spatial separation of the N- and C- termini. Three of the type 2A mutants were not secreted when studied within the VWF A2 domain FRET construct. Urea denaturation revealed for all 8 secreted mutants reduced unfolding cooperativity and stability of the VWF A2 domain. As folding stability was progressively disrupted, proteolysis by ADAMTS13 increased. Due to the range of folding stabilities and wide distribution of VWF A2 domain mutations studied, we conclude that these mutations disrupt regulated folding of the VWF A2 domain.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines two VWF mutations, R1597W (enhanced cleavage) and Y1605A-M1606A (decreased cleavage), to determine their impact on VWF, in addition to ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage.
METHODS: In vitro mouse ADAMTS13 digestions were performed on recombinant proteins. VWF knockout mice received hydrodynamic injections of mouse Vwf cDNA, following which VWF antigen, multimer profile and VWF propeptide levels were determined. A ferric chloride injury model of thrombosis was also evaluated.
RESULTS: In vitro ADAMTS13 digestion of full-length mouse VWF required > 97-fold higher ADAMTS13 levels for Y1605A/M1606A, and 68% lower ADAMTS13 levels for R1597W compared with wild type. In vivo, R1597W had reduced VWF:Ag and both mutations exhibited increased VWF propeptide/VWF:Ag ratios. R1597W multimers show a lower molecular weight profile compared with wild type and Y1605A/M1606A mice.

OBJECTIVES: We report here on several mutations that exclusively alter binding to type VI collagen.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Healthy controls and index cases from the Zimmerman Program for the Molecular and Clinical Biology of VWD were analyzed for VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin cofactor activity and VWF:CB with types I, III and VI collagen. VWF gene sequencing was performed for all subjects.
RESULTS: Two healthy controls and one type 1 VWD subject were heterozygous for an A1 domain sequence variation, R1399H, and displayed a selective decreased binding to type VI collagen but not types I and III. Expression of recombinant 1399H VWF resulted in absent binding to type VI collagen. Two other VWF A1 domain mutations, S1387I and Q1402P, displayed diminished binding to type VI collagen. An 11 amino acid deletion in the A1 domain also abrogated binding to type VI collagen.

Using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, the initial rates of VWF115 cleavage by ADAMTS13 at different substrate concentrations were determined, and from this the kinetic constants were derived (Km 1.61 microM; kcat 0.14 s(-1)), from which the specificity constant kcat/Km was calculated, 8.70 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). Similar values of the specificity constant were obtained for VWF76 and VWF115-A3. To identify residues important for recognition and proteolysis of VWF115, we introduced certain type 2A von Willebrand disease mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most were cleaved normally, one (D1614G) was cleaved approximately 8-fold slower.

Mutations in the A2 domain, which increase its susceptibility to cleavage, cause type 2A von Willebrand disease. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the A2 domain unfolds under tensile force progressively through a series of steps.

Furthermore, all three type 2A mutations lowered in silico the tensile force necessary to undock the C-terminal helix α6 from the rest of the A2 domain, the first event in the unfolding pathway.

31628947,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF), an exceptionally large multimeric plasma glycoprotein, functions to initiate coagulation by agglutinating platelets in the blood stream to sites of vascular injury. This primary hemostatic function is perturbed in type 2 dysfunctional subtypes of von Willebrand disease (VWD) by mutations that alter the structure and function of the platelet GPIbα adhesive VWF A1 domains. The resulting amino acid substitutions cause local disorder and misfold the native structure of the isolated platelet GPIbα-adhesive A1 domain of VWF in both gain-of-function (type 2B) and loss-of-function (type 2M) phenotypes. These structural effects have not been explicitly observed in A1 domains of VWF multimers native to blood plasma. New mass spectrometry strategies are applied to resolve the structural effects of 2B and 2M mutations in VWF to verify the presence of A1 domain structural disorder in multimeric VWF harboring type 2 VWD mutations. Limited trypsinolysis mass spectrometry (LTMS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) are applied to wild-type and VWD variants of the single A1, A2, and A3 domains, an A1A2A3 tridomain fragment of VWF, plasmin-cleaved dimers of VWF, multimeric recombinant VWF, and normal VWF plasma concentrates. Comparatively, these methods show that mutations known to misfold the isolated A1 domain increase the rate of trypsinolysis and the extent of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in local secondary structures of A1 within multimeric VWF. VWD mutation effects are localized to the A1 domain without appreciably affecting the structure and dynamics of other VWF domains. The intrinsic dynamics of A1 observed in recombinant fragments of VWF are conserved in plasma-derived VWF.

Approximately 80% of individuals with NS harbor mutations in genes whose products are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, the underlying genetic causes in nearly 20% of individuals with NS phenotype remain unexplained. Here, we report four de novo RRAS2 variants in three individuals with NS. RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly. The same dose injection of mRNA encoding c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu) caused severe developmental impairments and low dose overexpression of this variant induced craniofacial defects. In contrast, the RRAS2 c.224T>G (p.Phe75Cys) change, located on the same allele with p.Gln72His in an individual with NS, resulted in no aberrant in vitro or in vivo phenotypes by itself.

31130282,"Aberrant signaling through pathways controlling cell response to extracellular stimuli constitutes a central theme in disorders affecting development. Signaling through RAS and the MAPK cascade controls a variety of cell decisions in response to cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, and its upregulation causes Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder whose major features include a distinctive facies, a wide spectrum of cardiac defects, short stature, variable cognitive impairment, and predisposition to malignancies. NS is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in more than ten genes have been reported to underlie this disorder. Despite the large number of genes implicated, about 10%-20% of affected individuals with a clinical diagnosis of NS do not have mutations in known RASopathy-associated genes, indicating that additional unidentified genes contribute to the disease, when mutated. By using a mixed strategy of functional candidacy and exome sequencing, we identify RRAS2 as a gene implicated in NS in six unrelated subjects/families. We show that the NS-causing RRAS2 variants affect highly conserved residues localized around the nucleotide binding pocket of the GTPase and are predicted to variably affect diverse aspects of RRAS2 biochemical behavior, including nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and interaction with effectors.

28676641,"Dynamin-2 is a ubiquitously expressed GTP-ase that mediates membrane remodeling. Recent findings indicate that dynamin-2 also regulates actin dynamics. Mutations in dynamin-2 cause dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a congenital myopathy characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles. However, the muscle-specific roles of dynamin-2 affected by these mutations remain elusive. Here we show that, in muscle cells, the GTP-ase activity of dynamin-2 is involved in de novo actin polymerization as well as in actin-mediated trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4. Expression of dynamin-2 constructs carrying CNM-linked mutations disrupted the formation of new actin filaments as well as the stimulus-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Similarly, mature muscle fibers isolated from heterozygous knock-in mice that harbor the dynamin-2 mutation p.R465W, an animal model of CNM, exhibited altered actin organization, reduced actin polymerization and impaired insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma. Moreover, GLUT4 displayed aberrant perinuclear accumulation in biopsies from CNM patients carrying dynamin-2 mutations, further suggesting trafficking defects. These results suggest that dynamin-2 is a key regulator of actin dynamics and GLUT4 trafficking in muscle cells.

Self-assembly on phosphoinositide-containing membranes stimulates dynamin GTPase activity, which is crucial for its function. Although the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain is known to mediate phosphoinositide binding by dynamin, it remains unclear how this promotes activation. Here, we describe studies of dynamin PH domain mutations found in centronuclear myopathy (CNM) that increase dynamin's GTPase activity without altering phosphoinositide binding. CNM mutations in the PH domain C-terminal α-helix appear to cause conformational changes in dynamin that alter control of the GTP hydrolysis cycle. These mutations either 'sensitize' dynamin to lipid stimulation or elevate basal GTPase rates by promoting self-assembly and thus rendering dynamin no longer lipid responsive. We also describe a low-resolution structure of dimeric dynamin from small-angle X-ray scattering that reveals conformational changes induced by CNM mutations, and defines requirements for domain rearrangement upon dynamin self-assembly at membrane surfaces.

34744632,"Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 2 (DNM2), a GTPase that catalyzes membrane constriction and fission, are associated with two autosomal-dominant motor disorders, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and centronuclear myopathy (CNM), which affect nerve and muscle, respectively. Many of these mutations affect the pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2, yet there is almost no overlap between the sets of mutations that cause CMT or CNM. A subset of CMT-linked mutations inhibit the interaction of DNM2 with phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, which is essential for DNM2 function in endocytosis. In contrast, CNM-linked mutations inhibit intramolecular interactions that normally suppress dynamin self-assembly and GTPase activation. Hence, CNM-linked DNM2 mutants form abnormally stable polymers and express enhanced assembly-dependent GTPase activation. These distinct effects of CMT and CNM mutations are consistent with current findings that DNM2-dependent CMT and CNM are loss-of-function and gain-of-function diseases, respectively. In this study, we present evidence that at least one CMT-causing DNM2 mutant (ΔDEE; lacking residues 555DEE557) forms polymers that, like the CNM mutants, are resistant to disassembly and display enhanced GTPase activation. We further show that the ΔDEE mutant undergoes 2-3-fold higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation than wild-type DNM2.

20529869,"Mutations in the dynamin 2 gene have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant forms of centronuclear myopathy (CNM). Dynamin 2 is a ubiquitously expressed approximately 100-kDa GTPase that assembles around the necks of vesiculating membranes and promotes their constriction and scission. It has also been implicated in regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. At present, the cellular functions of dynamin 2 that are affected by CNM-linked mutations are not well defined, and the effects of these mutations on the physical and enzymatic properties of dynamin have been not examined. Here, we report the expression, purification, and characterization of four CNM-associated dynamin mutants. All four mutants display higher than wild-type GTPase activities, and more importantly, the mutants form high order oligomers that are significantly more resistant than wild-type dynamin 2 to disassembly by guanine nucleotides or high ionic strength. These observations suggest that the corresponding wild-type residues serve to prevent excessive or prolonged dynamin assembly on cellular membranes or inappropriate self-assembly in the cytoplasm.

We have previously shown that reduction of the large GTPase DNM2 in a mouse model of the X-linked form, due to loss of myotubularin phosphatase MTM1, prevents the development of the skeletal muscle pathophysiology. As DNM2 is mutated in autosomal dominant forms, here we tested whether DNM2 reduction can rescue DNM2-related CNM in a knock-in mouse harboring the p.R465W mutation (Dnm2RW/+) and displaying a mild CNM phenotype similar to patients with the same mutation. A single intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus-shRNA targeting Dnm2 resulted in reduction in protein levels 5 wk post injection, with a corresponding improvement in muscle mass and fiber size distribution, as well as an improvement in histopathological CNM features. To establish a systemic treatment, weekly i.p. injections of antisense oligonucleotides targeting Dnm2 were administered to Dnm2RW/+mice for 5 wk. While muscle mass, histopathology, and muscle ultrastructure were perturbed in Dnm2RW/+mice compared with wild-type mice, these features were indistinguishable from wild-type mice after reducing DNM2. Therefore, DNM2 knockdown via two different strategies can efficiently correct the myopathy due to DNM2 mutations, and it provides a common therapeutic strategy for several forms of centronuclear myopathy.

We used human genotype-phenotype correlation data to develop a myotubularin-deficient mouse model with a less severe phenotype than is seen in Mtm1 KO mice.

29734338,"RIT1 belongs to the RAS family of small GTPases. Germline and somatic RIT1 mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome (NS) and cancer, respectively. By using heterologous expression systems and purified recombinant proteins, we identified the p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as novel direct effector of RIT1. We found RIT1 also to directly interact with the RHO GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, both of which are crucial regulators of actin dynamics upstream of PAK1. These interactions are independent of the guanine nucleotide bound to RIT1. Disease-causing RIT1 mutations enhance protein-protein interaction between RIT1 and PAK1, CDC42 or RAC1 and uncouple complex formation from serum and growth factors. We show that the RIT1-PAK1 complex regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements as expression of wild-type RIT1 and its mutant forms resulted in dissolution of stress fibers and reduction of mature paxillin-containing focal adhesions in COS7 cells. This effect was prevented by co-expression of RIT1 with dominant-negative CDC42 or RAC1 and kinase-dead PAK1. By using a transwell migration assay, we show that RIT1 wildtype and the disease-associated variants enhance cell motility. Our work demonstrates a new function for RIT1 in controlling actin dynamics via acting in a signaling module containing PAK1 and RAC1/CDC42, and highlights defects in cell adhesion and migration as possible disease mechanism underlying NS.",PS3_supporting,NM_006912.6:c.268A>G,ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays in HEK293T cells showed elevated and prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation indicating that this variant impacts protein function.,,1,"Gene: RIT1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr1_155904472_T_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr1_155874263_T_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.155904472T>C, HGVSg (hg37): g.155874263T>C, rsID: N/A, HGVSc: c.268A>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Met90Val, HGVSp (1-letter): p.M90V"
28229161,"Antithrombin is an anticoagulant serpin that efficiently inhibits multiple procoagulant proteases. The cost for the structural flexibility required for this function is the vulnerability to mutations that impact its folding pathway. Most conformational mutations identified in serpins cause polymerisation. Only three mutations in SERPINC1 affecting two residues have been found to favour transformation to the latent conformation of antithrombin, another hyperstable non-anticoagulant form with strong antiangiogenic activity that constitutes 3 % of plasma antithrombin in healthy subjects. The analysis of latent antithrombin in 141 unrelated patients with antithrombin deficiency carrying 89 different SERPINC1 mutations identified four cases with higher levels than that of controls: p.Pro439Thr, p.Pro461Ser, p.Met283Val, and p.His401Tyr, the last also with circulating polymers. Heating of plasma at 42ºC exacerbated the transformation to the latent conformation in p.Pro439Thr and p.Pro461Ser. The conformational effect of p.Met283Val, the mutation associated with the highest levels of latent antithrombin detected in four members of a family, was verified in a recombinant model. Antithrombin deficiency in these cases should be classified as pleiotropic based on the impaired reactivity and low heparin affinity of the variant. Despite high levels of latent antithrombin (up to 80 µg/ml in p.Met283Val carriers), no vascular defects were described in carriers of these mutations. In conclusion, our study identifies new residues involved in the structural stability of antithrombin (and potentially of all serpins).

We identified two mutations that together makeup greater than 95% of the mutant LDL receptor genes represented in our sample. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that result in single-amino acid changes. Each mutation can be detected readily with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The finding of two common LDL receptor mutations in the Afrikaner FH homozygotes predicts that these mutations will predominate in the Afrikaner population and that the high frequency of FH is due to a founder effect.

The aim of the study was to identify rare single nucleotide variants and small indels in 40 established or candidate CRC susceptibility genes in 1,046 familial CRC cases (including both MSS and MSI-H tumor subtypes) and 1,006 unrelated controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort using a robust and cost-effective DNA pooling NGS strategy.

They are caused by germline variants in genes encoding key components or modulators of the highly conserved RAS-MAPK signalling pathway that lead to dysregulation of cell signal transmission. Germline changes in the genes encoding members of the RAS subfamily of GTPases are rare and associated with variable phenotypes of the RASopathy spectrum, ranging from Costello syndrome (HRAS variants) to Noonan and Cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes (KRAS variants). A small number of RASopathy cases with disease-causing germline NRAS alterations have been reported. Affected individuals exhibited features fitting Noonan syndrome, and the observed germline variants differed from the typical oncogenic NRAS changes occurring as somatic events in tumours. Here we describe 19 new cases with RASopathy due to disease-causing variants in NRAS. Importantly, four of them harbored missense changes affecting Gly12, which was previously described to occur exclusively in cancer. The phenotype in our cohort was variable but well within the RASopathy spectrum.

We determined the functional consequences of three mutations linked to FHM3 (L263V, Q1489K, and L1649Q) in an effort to identify molecular defects that underlie this inherited migraine disorder. Only L263V and Q1489K generated quantifiable sodium currents when coexpressed in tsA201 cells with the human beta(1) and beta(2) accessory subunits. The third mutant, L1649Q, failed to generate measurable whole-cell current because of markedly reduced cell surface expression. Compared to WT-Na(V)1.1, Q1489K exhibited increased persistent current but also enhanced entry into slow inactivation as well as delayed recovery from fast and slow inactivation, thus resulting in a predominantly loss-of-function phenotype further demonstrated by a greater loss of channel availability during repetitive stimulation. In contrast, L263V exhibited gain-of-function features, including delayed entry into, as well as accelerated recovery from, fast inactivation; depolarizing shifts in the steady-state voltage dependence of fast and slow inactivation; increased persistent current; and delayed entry into slow inactivation. Notably, the two mutations (Q1489K and L1649Q) that exhibited partial or complete loss of function are linked to typical FHM, whereas the gain-of-function mutation L263V occurred in a family having both FHM and a high incidence of generalized epilepsy.

Simulation of neuronal firing and long depolarizing pulses mimicking promigraine conditions revealed that the effect of the mutation is a gain of function consistent with increased neuronal firing. However, during high-frequency discharges and long depolarizations, the effect became a loss of function. Recordings of firing of transfected neurons showed higher firing frequency at the beginning of long discharges. This self-limited capacity to induce neuronal hyperexcitability may be a specific characteristic of migraine mutations, able to both trigger the cascade of events that leads to migraine and counteract the development of extreme hyperexcitability typical of epileptic seizures.

We assessed the diagnosis rate and genetic spectrum of MgD using next-generation sequencing in patients with late adolescence/adult-onset diabetes referred for a clinical suspicion of MgD.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in 1564 probands recruited in 116 Endocrinology departments. Inclusion criteria were the absence of diabetes autoantibodies, and at least two of the three following criteria: an age ≤ 40 years and a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2 at diagnosis in the proband or in at least two relatives with diabetes, and a family history of diabetes in ≥ 2 generations. Seven genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, ABCC8, KCNJ11, and INS) were analyzed. Variant pathogenicity was assessed using current guidelines.
RESULTS: Pathogenic variants were identified in 254 patients (16.2%) and in 23.2% of EuroCaucasian patients. Using more stringent selection criteria (family history of diabetes in ≥ 3 generations, age at diabetes ≤ 40 years and BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 in the proband, EuroCaucasian origin) increased the diagnosis rate to 43%, but with 70% of the identified cases being missed. GCK (44%), HNF1A (33%), and HNF4A (10%) accounted for the majority of the cases. HNF1B (6%), ABCC8/KCNJ11 (4.4%), and INS (2.8%) variants accounted for 13% of the cases. As compared to non-monogenic cases, a younger age, a lower BMI and the absence of diabetes symptoms at diagnosis, a EuroCaucasian origin, and a family history of diabetes in ≥ 3 generations were associated with MgD, but with wide phenotype overlaps between the two groups. In the total population, two clusters were identified, that mainly differed by the severity of diabetes at onset. MgDs were more prevalent in the milder phenotypic cluster. The phenotypes of the 59 patients (3.8%) with variants of uncertain significance were different from that of patients with pathogenic variants, but not from that of non-monogenic patients.

33198351,"The lysosomal storage disorder, mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI), results from mutations in IDUA, the gene that encodes the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzyme α-L-iduronidase. Newborn screening efforts for MPSI have greatly increased the number of novel IDUA variants identified, but with insufficient experimental evidence regarding their pathogenicity, many of these variants remain classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Defining pathogenicity for novel IDUA variants is critical for decisions regarding medical management and early intervention. Here, we describe a biochemical platform for the characterization of IDUA variants that relies on viral delivery of IDUA DNA into IDUA-deficient HAP1 cells and isolation of single cell expression clones. The relative specific activity of wild-type and variant α-iduronidase was determined using a combination of Western blot analysis and α-iduronidase activity assays. The specific activity of each variant enzyme was consistent across different single cell clones despite variable IDUA expression and could be accurately determined down to 0.05-0.01% of WT α-iduronidase activity. With this strategy we compared the specific activities of known pseudodeficiency variants (p.His82Gln, p.Ala79Thr, p.Val322Glu, p.Asp223Asn) or pathogenic variants (p.Ser633Leu, p.His240Arg) with variants of uncertain significance (p.Ser586Phe, p.Ile272Leu).

Cell clones expressing the p.Ser586Phe and p.Ile272Leu variants had specific activities in the range of other pseudodeficiency variants tested. Our findings show that pseudodeficiency and pathogenic variants can be distinguished from each other with regard to specific activity, and confirms that all the pseudodeficiency variants variably reduce α-iduronidase activity.

27214402,"In human mitochondria, the AUA codon encodes methionine via a mitochondrial transfer RNA for methionine (mt-tRNA(Met)) that contains 5-formylcytidine (f(5)C) at the first position of the anticodon (position 34). f(5)C34 is required for deciphering the AUA codon during protein synthesis. Until now, the biogenesis and physiological role of f(5)C34 were unknown. We demonstrate that biogenesis of f(5)C34 is initiated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methylation catalyzed by NSUN3, a putative methyltransferase in mitochondria. NSUN3-knockout cells showed strong reduction in mitochondrial protein synthesis and reduced oxygen consumption, leading to deficient mitochondrial activity. We reconstituted formation of 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) at position 34 (m(5)C34) on mt-tRNA(Met) with recombinant NSUN3 in the presence of AdoMet, demonstrating that NSUN3-mediated m(5)C34 formation initiates f(5)C34 biogenesis.

23613869,"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common disease entity among non-dystrophic skeletal muscle congenital diseases. Mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) account for ∼25% of all NM cases and are the most frequent cause of severe forms of NM. So far, the mechanisms underlying muscle weakness in NM patients remain unclear. Additionally, recent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies reported a progressive fatty infiltration of skeletal muscle with a specific muscle involvement in patients with ACTA1 mutations. We investigated strictly noninvasively the gastrocnemius muscle function of a mouse model carrying a mutation in the ACTA1 gene (H40Y). Skeletal muscle anatomy (hindlimb muscles and fat volumes) and energy metabolism were studied using MRI and (31)Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Skeletal muscle contractile performance was investigated while applying a force-frequency protocol (from 1-150 Hz) and a fatigue protocol (80 stimuli at 40 Hz). H40Y mice showed a reduction of both absolute (-40%) and specific (-25%) maximal force production as compared to controls. Interestingly, muscle weakness was associated with an improved resistance to fatigue (+40%) and an increased energy cost. On the contrary, the force frequency relationship was not modified in H40Y mice and the extent of fatty infiltration was minor and not different from the WT group. We concluded that the H40Y mouse model does not reproduce human MRI findings but shows a severe muscle weakness which might be related to an alteration of intrinsic muscular properties. The increased energy cost in H40Y mice might be related to either an impaired mitochondrial function or an alteration at the cross-bridges level.

Some of these variants can result in incorrect folding of the LDLR protein, which is then accumulated inside the cell and cannot fulfill its function to internalize LDL particles. We analyzed the functional impact of 10 LDLR variants localized in the beta-propeller of epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The experimental part of the work was complemented by a structural analysis on the basis of 3D LDLR protein structure. Methods: T-Rex Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human LDLR gene were used for live cell imaging microscopy, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR analysis. Results: Our results showed that the analyzed LDLR protein variants can be divided into three groups. (1) The variants buried inside the 3D protein structure expressing proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no or reduced plasma membrane localization and LDL particle internalization, and associated with an increased gene expression of ER-resident chaperones. (2) The variants localized on the surface of 3D protein structure with slightly reduced LDLR plasma membrane localization and LDL particle internalization, and associated with no increased mRNA level of ER-resident chaperones.

21511053,"The LDL receptor (LDLR) is an endocytic receptor that plays a major role in the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation. During the endocytic process, the LDLR first binds lipoprotein at the cell surface and then traffics to endosomes, where the receptor releases bound lipoprotein. Release is acid-dependent and correlates with the formation of an intramolecular contact within the receptor. Human mutations at residues that form the contact are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and the goal of the present study was to determine the role of contact residues on LDLR function. We show that mutations at nine contact residues reduce the ability of the LDLR to support lipoprotein uptake. Unexpectedly, only four of the mutations (W515A, W541A, H562Y and H586Y) impaired acid-dependent lipoprotein release. The remaining mutations decreased the lipoprotein-binding capacity of the LDLR through either reduction in the number of surface receptors (H190Y, K560W, H562Y and K582W) or reduction in the fraction of surface receptors that were competent to bind lipoprotein (W144A and W193A). We also examined three residues, distal to the contact, which were predicted to be necessary for the LDLR to adopt the acidic conformation. Of the three mutations we tested (G293S, F362A and G375S), one mutation (F362A) reduced lipoprotein uptake.

18535179,"Sarcoglycanopathies are progressive muscle-wasting disorders caused by genetic defects of four proteins, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan, which are elements of a key transmembrane complex of striated muscle. The proper assembly of the sarcoglycan complex represents a critical issue of sarcoglycanopathies, as several mutations severely perturb tetramer formation. Misfolded proteins are generally degraded through the cell's quality-control system; however, this can also lead to the removal of some functional polypeptides. To explore whether it is possible to rescue sarcoglycan mutants by preventing their degradation, we generated a heterologous cell system, based on human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, constitutively expressing three (beta, gamma, and delta) of the four sarcoglycans. In these betagammadelta-HEK cells, the lack of alpha-sarcoglycan prevented complex formation and cell surface localization, wheras the presence of alpha-sarcoglycan allowed maturation and targeting of the tetramer. As in muscles of sarcoglycanopathy patients, transfection of betagammadelta-HEK cells with disease-causing alpha-sarcoglycan mutants led to dramatic reduction of the mutated proteins and the absence of the complex from the cell surface. Proteasomal inhibition reduced the degradation of mutants and facilitated the assembly and targeting of the sarcoglycan complex to the plasma membrane.

33692461,"INTRODUCTION: While the acquisition of mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain (KD) has been identified as a common mechanism behind tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, recent genetic studies have revealed that patients with TKI resistance or intolerance frequently harbor one or more genetic alterations implicated in myeloid malignancies. This suggests that additional mutations other than ABL1 KD mutations might contribute to disease progression.
METHODS: We performed targeted-capture sequencing of 127 known and putative cancer-related genes of 63 patients with CML using next-generation sequencing (NGS), including 42 patients with TKI resistance and 21 with TKI intolerance.
RESULTS: The differences in the number of mutations between groups had no statistical significance. This could be explained in part by not all of the patients having achieved major molecular remission in the early period as expected. Overall, 66 mutations were identified in 96.8% of the patients, most frequently in the KTM2C (31.82%), ABL1 (31.82%), FAT1 (25.76%), and ASXL1 (22.73%) genes. CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 were associated with TKI intolerance, and two of them (CUX1, GATA2) are transcription factors in which mutations were identified in 82.61% of patients with TKI intolerance. ASXL1 mutations were found more frequently in patients with ABL1 KD mutations (38.1% vs 15.21%, P=0.041). Although the number of mutations was low, pairwise interaction between mutated genes showed that ABL1 KD mutations cooccurred with SH2B3 mutations (P&lt;0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, only TET2 mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (P=0.026).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 genes may play important roles in TKI intolerance. ASXL1 and TET2 mutations may be associated with poor patient prognosis. NGS helps improving the clinical risk stratification, which enables the identification of patients with TKI resistance or intolerance in the era of TKI therapy.",PS3_moderate,NM_001754.5:c.433A>G,"Data from two or more secondary assays (FRET assay and SEUSS) demonstrate altered function, including decreased phosphorylation of RUNX1 and decreased gene expression",,1,"Gene: RUNX1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr21_34880632_T_C, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr21_36252929_T_C, HGVSg (hg38): g.34880632T>C, HGVSg (hg37): g.36252929T>C, rsID: rs757288001, HGVSc: c.433A>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg145Gly, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R145G"

In patients without cone vision, rod vision functioned unsaturated under bright ambient illumination. In vitro analyses of the mutant alleles showed that in addition to the major truncation of the essential catalytic domain in RetGC1, some missense mutations in LCA1 patients result in a severe loss of function by inactivating its catalytic activity and/or ability to interact with the activator proteins, GCAPs. The differences in rod sensitivities among patients were not explained by the biochemical properties of the mutants. However, the RetGC1 mutant alleles with remaining biochemical activity in vitro were associated with retained cone vision in vivo.

27881908,"PURPOSE: To test, in living photoreceptors, two mutations, S248W and R1091x, in the GUCY2D gene linked to Leber congenital amaurosis 1 (LCA1) that fail to inactivate the catalytic activity of a heterologously expressed retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase 1 (RetGC1).
METHODS: GUC2YD cDNA constructs coding for wild-type human (hWT), R1091x, and S248W GUCY2D under the control of the human rhodopsin kinase promoter were expressed in Gucy2e-/-Gucy2f-/- knockout (GCdKO) mouse retinas, which lack endogenous RetGC activity. The constructs were delivered via subretinally injected adenoassociated virus (AAV) vector in one eye, leaving the opposite eye as the non-injected negative control. After testing with electroretinography (ERG), the retinas extracted from the AAV-treated and control eyes were used in guanylyl cyclase activity assays, immunoblotting, and anti-RetGC1 immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Cyclase activity in retinas treated with either hWT or R1091x GUCY2D transgenes was similar but was undetectable in the S248W GUCY2D-treated retinas, which starkly contrasts their relative activities when heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Rod and cone ERGs, absent in GCdKO, appeared in the hWT and R1091x GUCY2D-injected eyes, while the S248W mutant failed to restore scotopic ERG response and enabled only rudimentary photopic ERG response. The hWT and R1091x GUCY2D immunofluorescence was robust in the rod and cone outer segments, whereas the S248W was detectable only in the sparse cone outer segments and sporadic photoreceptor cell bodies. Robust RetGC1 expression was detected with immunoblotting in the hWT and R1091x-treated retinas but was marginal at best in the S248W GUCY2D retinas, despite the confirmed presence of the S248W GUCY2D transcripts.
CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of S248W GUCY2D in living retinas did not correlate with the previously described normal biochemical activity of this mutant when heterologously expressed in non-photoreceptor cell culture. This result suggests that the S248W mutation contributes to LCA1 by hampering the expression, processing, and/or cellular transport of GUCY2D, rather than its enzymatic properties. In contrast, the effective restoration of rod and cone function by R1091x GUCY2D is paradoxical and does not explain the severe loss of vision typical for LCA1 associated with that mutant allele.",PS3_supporting,NM_000180.4:c.743C>G,"Gucy2e-knockout mouse retinas injected with an adeno-associated virus-packaged GUCY2D construct encoding the p.Ser248Trp variant showed mRNA levels similar to the wild-type control but dramatically reduced protein levels and essentially no cGMP production, indicating that it triggers a severe defect in protein function",,1,"Gene: GUCY2D, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr17_8003873_C_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr17_7907191_C_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.8003873C>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.7907191C>G, rsID: rs138922415, HGVSc: c.743C>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Ser248Trp, HGVSp (1-letter): p.S248W"
25477517,"One-fifth of all cases of Leber congenital amaurosis are type 1 (LCA1). LCA1 is a severe form of retinal dystrophy caused by loss-of-function mutations in guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1), a key member of the phototransduction cascade involved in modulating the photocurrents. Although GC1 has been studied for some time, the mechanisms responsible for its regulation and membrane targeting are not fully understood. We reported earlier that retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein interacts with GC1 and promotes its targeting to the photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Here, we extend our studies to show a direct association between RD3 and guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this functional interaction is important for GC1 targeting to POS. We also show that most LCA1-causing mutations in GC1 result in lost GC1 interaction with RD3 or GC1 being targeted to the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that GC1, GCAP1, and RD3 form a complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that targets GC1 to POS. Interruption of this assembly is likely the underlying mechanism for a subset of LCA1.

24616660,"Membrane bound guanylate cyclases are expressed in rod and cone cells of the vertebrate retina and mutations in several domains of rod outer segment guanylate cyclase 1 (ROS-GC1 encoded by the gene GUCY2D) correlate with different forms of retinal degenerations. In the present work we investigated the biochemical consequences of three point mutations, one is located in position P575L in the juxtamembrane domain close to the kinase homology domain and two are located in the cyclase catalytic domain at H1019P and P1069R. These mutations correlate with various retinal diseases like autosomal dominant progressive cone degeneration, e.g., Leber Congenital Amaurosis and a juvenile form of retinitis pigmentosa. Wildtype and mutant forms of ROS-GC1 were heterologously expressed in HEK cells, their cellular distribution was investigated and activity profiles in the presence and absence of guanylate cyclase-activating proteins were measured. The mutant P575L was active under all tested conditions, but it displayed a twofold shift in the Ca(2) (+)-sensitivity, whereas the mutant P1069R remained inactive despite normal expression levels. The mutation H1019P caused the cyclase to become more labile. The different biochemical consequences of these mutations seem to reflect the different clinical symptoms. The mutation P575L induces a dysregulation of the Ca(2) (+)-sensitive cyclase activation profile causing a slow progression of the disease by the distortion of the Ca(2) (+)-cGMP homeostasis.

8621553,"The interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) A1 domain and platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha occurs in the presence of high shear stress or when vWF becomes immobilized onto a surface but not appreciably in the normal circulation. To investigate the structural properties regulating A1 domain function, we have used recombinant fragments prepared either in cyclic form with oxidized Cys509-Cys695 disulfide bond or reduced and alkylated. Interaction with glycoprotein Ibalpha was assessed by testing inhibition of monoclonal antibody LJ-Ib1 binding to platelets and inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation mediated by native vWF. Fragments exposed to pH between 2.5 and 3.5 adopted the molten globule conformation with loosened tertiary structure intermediate between native and completely unordered state. Maximal receptor binding activity was observed when fragments kept at acidic pH, particularly after reduction of the Cys509-Cys695 disulfide bond, were subjected to quick refolding by rapid pH increase. In contrast, slow refolding by incremental pH change over several hours resulted in at least 20-fold lower activity.

In this report, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying a deafness-associated tRNAIle 4295A>G mutation affecting a highly conserved adenosine at position 37, 3' adjacent to the tRNA's anticodon. Primer extension and methylation activity assays revealed that the m.4295A>G mutation introduced a tRNA methyltransferase 5 (TRMT5)-catalyzed m1G37 modification of tRNAIle. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the m.4295A>G mutation affected tRNAIle structure and function, supported by increased melting temperature, conformational changes and instability of mutated tRNA. An in vitro processing experiment revealed that the m.4295A>G mutation reduced the 5' end processing efficiency of tRNAIle precursors, catalyzed by RNase P. We demonstrated that cybrid cell lines carrying the m.4295A>G mutation exhibited significant alterations in aminoacylation and steady-state levels of tRNAIle.

39114568,"BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased LDL-cholesterol levels. About 85% of FH cases are caused by LDLR mutations encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). LDLR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it undergoes post-translational modifications and then transported through Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Over 2900 LDLR variants have been reported in FH patients with limited information on the pathogenicity and functionality of many of them. This study aims to elucidate the cellular trafficking and functional implications of LDLR missense variants identified in suspected FH patients using biochemical and functional methods.
METHODS: We used HeLa, HEK293T, and LDLR-deficient-CHO-ldlA7 cells to evaluate the subcellular localization and LDL internalization of ten LDLR missense variants (p.C167F, p.D178N, p.C243Y, p.E277K, p.G314R, p.H327Y, p.D477N, p.D622G, p.R744Q, and p.R814Q) reported in multiethnic suspected FH patients. We also analyzed the functional impact of three variants (p.D445E, p.D482H, and p.C677F), two of which previously shown to be retained in the ER.
RESULTS: We show that p.D622G, p.D482H, and p.C667F are largely retained in the ER whereas p.R744Q is partially retained. The other variants were predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. LDL internalization assays in CHO-ldlA7 cells indicate that p.D482H, p.C243Y, p.D622G, and p.C667F have quantitatively lost their ability to internalize Dil-LDL with the others (p.C167F, p.D178N, p.G314R, p.H327Y, p.D445E, p.D477N, p.R744Q and p.R814Q) showing significant losses except for p.E277K which retained full activity. However, the LDL internalization assay is only to able evaluate the impact of the variants on LDL internalization and not the exact functional defects such as failure to bind LDL. The data represented illustrate the hypomorphism nature of variants causing FH which may explain some of the variable expressivity of FH.

2011604,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) supports platelet adhesion on thrombogenic surfaces by binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib in the GP Ib-IX receptor complex. This interaction is physiologically regulated so that it does not occur between circulating vWF and platelets but, rather, only at a site of vascular injury. The abnormal vWF found in type IIB von Willebrand disease, however, has a characteristically increased affinity for GP Ib and binds to circulating platelets. We have analyzed the molecular basis of this abnormality by sequence analysis of a type IIB vWF cDNA and have identified a single amino acid change, Trp550 to Cys550, located in the GP Ib-binding domain of the molecule comprising residues 449-728. Bacterial expression of recombinant fragments corresponding to this vWF domain yielded molecules that, whether containing a normal Trp550 or a mutant Cys550 residue, bound directly to GP Ib in the absence of modulators and with similar affinity. In contrast, mammalian cell expression of the same segment of sequence yielded molecules that, when containing the normal Trp550, did not bind to GP Ib directly but, like native vWF, bound in the presence of ristocetin. However, molecules containing the point mutation (Cys550) behaved like type IIB vWF--namely, bound to GP Ib even without ristocetin modulation and, in the presence of ristocetin, had 10-fold higher affinity than molecules with normal sequence.

17999356,"Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is an inborn mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (FAO) defect associated with a broad mutational spectrum, with phenotypes ranging from fatal cardiopathy in infancy to adolescent-onset myopathy, and for which there is no established treatment. Recent data suggest that bezafibrate could improve the FAO capacities in beta-oxidation-deficient cells, by enhancing the residual level of mutant enzyme activity via gene-expression stimulation. Since VLCAD-deficient patients frequently harbor missense mutations with unpredictable effects on enzyme activity, we investigated the response to bezafibrate as a function of genotype in 33 VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts representing 45 different mutations. Treatment with bezafibrate (400 microM for 48 h) resulted in a marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of normal values, for 21 genotypes that mainly corresponded to patients with the myopathic phenotype. In contrast, bezafibrate induced no changes in FAO for 11 genotypes corresponding to severe neonatal or infantile phenotypes. This pattern of response was not due to differential inductions of VLCAD messenger RNA, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, but reflected variable increases in measured VLCAD residual enzyme activity in response to bezafibrate.

37520945,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of neuromuscular blocking agents between children and adults and limited studies which existing meta-analyses included, this study will update the safety and efficacy of sugammadex (Sug) sodium in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children.
METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of Sug sodium in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in children. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) for primary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) was calculated for secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: As of 2022-11-03, 18 out of 236 studies included 724 children in the intervention group and 478 children in the control group for meta-analysis. The results showed that compared with the control group, the time required for Train-of-Four Ratio (TOFR) to return to 0.9 and the extubation time were shortened in both 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg of Sug sodium, with statistically significant differences (TOFR ≥0.9: 2 mg/kg: SMD = -2.90; 95%CI: -3.75, -2.04; 4 mg/kg: -3.31; -4.79, -1.84; extubation time: 2 mg/kg: -2.95; -4.04, -1.85; 4 mg/kg: -1.57; -1.90, -1.23). Compared with the control group, the total incidence of adverse effects in the Sug group was lower (RR = 0.44; 0.24,0.82).

21645226,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE:  The factor VIII (FVIII) B domain shares very little amino acid homology with other known proteins and is not directly necessary for procoagulant activity. Despite this, missense mutations within the B domain have been reported in patients with hemophilia A. Given that the B domain is dispensable for secretion and function of FVIII, we hypothesized that these mutations should not be causative of hemophilia A in these patients.
METHODS:  Plasmid vectors containing B domain missense mutations that were reported to be associated with moderate/severe hemophilia A (T751S, D826E, V993L, H1047Y, T1353A, N1441K, L1462P, E1579D, A1591S, P1641L and S1669L) were analyzed for their effect on synthesis and secretion compared with FVIII wild-type (WT) following transient transfection into COS-1 and CHO cells in vitro. Further, H1047Y, N1441K and E1579D mutants were expressed in vivo in a hemophilia A mouse model by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection.
RESULTS:  FVIII activity and antigen levels for all mutants expressed into the conditioned media of COS-1 and CHO cells were similar to FVIII WT. Also, plasma expression of these mutants was similar to FVIII WT in hemophilia A mice. An in vivo tail clip bleeding assay also demonstrated that blood loss from hemophilia A mice expressing FVIII WT, H1047Y, N1441K and E1579D was similar.
CONCLUSIONS:  We conclude that most missense mutations within the FVIII B domain would be unlikely to lead to severe hemophilia A and that the majority of such missense mutations represent polymorphisms or non-pathologic mutations.",BS3,NM_000132.4:c.5063C>T,One-stage clotting assay and antigen specific ELISAs in CHO Chinese Hamster cell line and HEK293 human cells showed normal FVIII activity and antigen levels indicating that this variant does not impact protein function.,One-stage clotting assay and antigen specific ELISAs in CHO Chinese Hamster cell line and HEK293 human cells showed normal FVIII activity and antigen levels indicating that this variant does not impact protein function.,1,"Gene: F8, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chrX_154928727_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chrX_154157002_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.154928727G>A, HGVSg (hg37): g.154157002G>A, rsID: rs782235155, HGVSc: c.5063C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Ser1688Leu, HGVSp (1-letter): p.S1688L"
18400783,"Phenotypic diversity associated with pathogenic mutations of the human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) has often been explained by unequal segregation of the mutated and wild-type genomes (heteroplasmy). However, this simple hypothesis cannot explain the tissue specificity of disorders caused by homoplasmic mtDNA mutations. We have previously associated a homoplasmic point mutation (1624C>T) in MTTV with a profound metabolic disorder that resulted in the neonatal deaths of numerous siblings. Affected tissues harboured a marked biochemical defect in components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, presumably due to the extremely low (<1%) steady-state levels of mt-tRNA(Val). In primary myoblasts and transmitochondrial cybrids established from the proband (index case) and offspring, the marked respiratory deficiency was lost and steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA(Val) were greater than in the biopsy material, but were still an order of magnitude lower than in control myoblasts. We present evidence that the generalized decrease in steady-state mt-tRNA(Val) observed in the homoplasmic 1624C>T-cell lines is caused by a rapid degradation of the deacylated form of the abnormal mt-tRNA(Val). By both establishing the identity of the human mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase then inducing its overexpression in transmitochondrial cell lines, we have been able to partially restore steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA(Val), consistent with an increased stability of the charged mt-tRNA.

33740971,"BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by pathogenic germline variants in the APC gene. To date, multiple pathogenic variants in coding regions, splice sites, and deep intronic regions have been revealed. However, there are still pathogenic variants that remain unidentified.
METHODS: Twenty-nine primer pairs flanking exons 2-16 (i.e., coding exons 1-15) of APC and their exon-intron junctions were used for germline pathogenic variant screening in Southern Thai patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Transcription analysis was performed to confirm the pathogenicity of a splice site deletion of intron 10. Family members were interviewed for clinical histories. Blood samples were collected from 18 family members for a segregation study. Subsequently, clinical data of affected members were collected from the hospital databases.
RESULTS: We found a distinct heterozygous 16-bp deletion at the splice donor site of intron 10 leading to a skipping of exon 10 which was confirmed by transcript analysis (APC: c 1312 + 4_1312 + 19del, r.934_1312del). Predictive testing for the pathogenic APC variant in 18 of the proband's family members (ten healthy and eight affected) from three generations showed the same heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in eight affected adult members (15-62 years old) and two children (7 and 10 years old). Seven of the ten carriers of the disease-causing variant had undergone colonoscopy, and colonic polyps were found in all cases, which confirmed the segregation of the inherited pathogenic variant. The phenotypic spectrum was found to vary within the family; and some affected family members exhibited extracolonic manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the pathogenic APC variant, c.1312 + 4_1312 + 19del, r.934_1312del, has not previously been reported.

15833136,"BACKGROUND: Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is caused by germline mutations in the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene. The vast majority of APC mutations are point mutations or small insertions/deletions which lead to truncated protein products. Splicing mutations or gross genomic rearrangements are less common inactivating events of the APC gene.
METHODS: In the current study genomic DNA or RNA from ten unrelated FAP suspected patients was examined for germline mutations in the APC gene. Family history and phenotype were used in order to select the patients. Methods used for testing were dHPLC (denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography), sequencing, MLPA (Multiplex Ligation - dependent Probe Amplification), Karyotyping, FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) and RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction).
RESULTS: A 250 Kbp deletion in the APC gene starting from intron 5 and extending beyond exon 15 was identified in one patient. A substitution of the +5 conserved nucleotide at the splice donor site of intron 9 in the APC gene was shown to produce frameshift and inefficient exon skipping in a second patient. Four frameshift mutations (1577insT, 1973delAG, 3180delAAAA, 3212delA) and a nonsense mutation (C1690T) were identified in the rest of the patients.

29851975,"X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal degenerative disorder caused by mutations in RS1 gene leading to splitting of retinal layers (schisis) which impairs visual signal processing. Retinoschisin (RS1) is an adhesive protein which is secreted predominantly by the photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a double-octameric complex. In general, XLRS patients show wide clinical heterogeneity, presenting practical challenges in disease management. Though researchers have attempted various approaches to offer an explanation for clinical heterogeneity, the molecular basis has not been understood yet. Therefore, this study aims at establishing a link between the phenotype and genotype based on the molecular mechanism exerted by the mutations. Twenty seven XLRS patients were enrolled, of which seven harboured novel mutations. The mutant constructs were genetically engineered and their secretion profiles were studied by in vitro cell culture experiments. Based on the secretory profile, the patients were categorized as either secreted or non-secreted group. Various clinical parameters such as visual acuity, location of schisis, foveal thickness and ERG parameters were compared between the two groups and control. Although the two groups showed severe disease phenotype in comparison with control, there was no significant difference between the two XLRS groups. However, the secreted group exhibited relatively severe disease indications. On the other hand molecular analysis suggests that most of the RS1 mutations result in intracellular retention of retinoschisin. Hence, clinical parameters of patients with non-secreted profile were analyzed which in turn revealed wide variability even within the group. Altogether, our results indicate that disease severity is not merely dependent on secretory profile of the mutations. Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients.",PS3_supporting,NM_000330.4:c.580ATC[3],COS-7 cells exogenously expressing the variant exhibit loss of RS1 secretion into the medium relative to the wild-type control,,1,"Gene: RS1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chrX_18642093_A_AGAT, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chrX_18660213_A_AGAT, HGVSg (hg38): g.18642098_18642100dup, HGVSg (hg37): g.18660218_18660220dup, rsID: rs1, HGVSc: c.580_585ATC[3], HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"
16361673,"BACKGROUND/AIM: X linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is caused by mutations in RS1 which encodes the discoidin domain protein retinoschisin, secreted by photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Missense mutations occur throughout the gene and some of these are known to interfere with protein secretion. This study was designed to investigate the functional consequences of missense mutations at different locations in retinoschisin.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors developed a structural model of the retinoschisin discoidin domain and used this to predict the effects of missense mutations. They expressed disease associated mutations and found that those affecting conserved residues prevented retinoschisin secretion. Most of the remaining mutations cluster within a series of loops on the surface of the beta barrel structure and do not interfere with secretion, suggesting this region may be a ligand binding site. They also demonstrated that wild type retinoschisin octamerises and associates with the cell surface. A subgroup of secreted mutations reduce oligomerisation (C59S, C219G, C223R).
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that there are three different molecular mechanisms which lead to XLRS: mutations interfering with secretion, mutations interfering with oligomerisation, and mutations that allow secretion and oligomerisation but interfere with retinoschisin function.

It functions as a cell adhesion protein to maintain the cellular organization and synaptic structure of the retina. Over 125 different mutations in the RS1 gene are associated with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, the most common form of early onset macular degeneration in males. To identify molecular determinants important for retinoschisin structure and function and elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, we have analyzed the expression, protein folding, disulfide-linked subunit assembly, intracellular localization, and secretion of wild-type retinoschisin, 15 Cys-to-Ser variants and 12 disease-linked mutants. Our studies, together with molecular modeling of the discoidin domain, identify Cys residues involved in intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds essential for protein folding and subunit assembly. We show that misfolding of the discoidin domain, defective disulfide-linked subunit assembly, and inability of retinoschisin to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as part of the protein secretion process are three primary mechanisms responsible for the loss in the function of retinoschisin as a cell adhesion protein and the pathogenesis of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.",PS3_supporting,NM_000330.4:c.214G>A,HEK293 cells exogenously expressing the variant exhibit loss of RS1 secretion into the medium relative to the wild-type control.,,1,"Gene: RS1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chrX_18647303_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chrX_18665423_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.18647303C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.18665423C>T, rsID: rs1, HGVSc: c.214G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Glu72Lys, HGVSp (1-letter): p.E72K"

The RS1 gene (MIM 300839) associated with the disease encodes retinoschisin, a 224 amino acid protein containing a discoidin domain as the major structural unit, an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, and regions responsible for subunit oligomerization. Retinoschisin is secreted from retinal cells as a disulphide-linked homo-octameric complex which binds to the surface of photoreceptors and bipolar cells to help maintain the integrity of the retina. Over 190 disease-causing mutations in the RS1 gene are known with most mutations occurring as non-synonymous changes in the discoidin domain. Cell expression studies have shown that disease-associated missense mutations in the discoidin domain cause severe protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, mutations in the signal sequence result in aberrant protein synthesis, and mutations in regions flanking the discoidin domain cause defective disulphide-linked subunit assembly, all of which produce a non-functional protein. Knockout mice deficient in retinoschisin have been generated and shown to display most of the characteristic features found in XLRS patients.

23213406,"Mutations affecting the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1) interactome cause syndromic retinal dystrophies. RPGRIP1 interacts with the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) through a domain homologous to RCC1 (RHD), a nucleotide exchange factor of Ran GTPase. However, functional relationships between RPGR and RPGRIP1 and their subcellular roles are lacking. We show by molecular modeling and analyses of RPGR disease-mutations that the RPGR-interacting domain (RID) of RPGRIP1 embraces multivalently the shared RHD of RPGR(1-19) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms and the mutations are non-overlapping with the interface found between RCC1 and Ran GTPase. RPGR disease-mutations grouped into six classes based on their structural locations and differential impairment with RPGRIP1 interaction. RPGRIP1α(1) expression alone causes its profuse self-aggregation, an effect suppressed by co-expression of either RPGR isoform before and after RPGRIP1α(1) self-aggregation ensue. RPGR(1-19) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas RPGR(ORF15) presents cytosolic distribution and they determine uniquely the subcellular co-localization of RPGRIP1α(1). Disease mutations in RPGR(1) (-19), RPGR(ORF15), or RID of RPGRIP1α(1), singly or in combination, exert distinct effects on the subcellular targeting, co-localization or tethering of RPGRIP1α(1) with RPGR(1-19) or RPGR(ORF15) in kidney, photoreceptor and hepatocyte cell lines. Additionally, RPGR(ORF15), but not RPGR(1-19), protects the RID of RPGRIP1α(1) from limited proteolysis. These studies define RPGR- and cell-type-dependent targeting pathways with structural and functional plasticity modulating the expression of mutations in RPGR and RPGRIP1.

30622176,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disease with severe vision impairment leading to blindness. About 10-15% of RP cases are caused by mutations in the RPGR gene, with RPGR mutations accounting for 70% of X-linked RP cases. The mechanism by which RPGR mutations cause photoreceptor cell dysfunction is not well understood. In this study, we show that the two isoforms of RPGR (RPGR1-19 and RPGRORF15) interact with endogenous PDE6D, INPP5E, and RPGRIP1L. The RPGR1-19 isoform contains two PDE6D binding sites with the C-terminal prenylation site being the predominant PDE6D binding site. The C terminus of RPGR1-19 that contains the prenylation site regulates its interaction with PDE6D, INPP5E, and RPGRIP1L. Only the RPGR1-19 isoform localizes to cilia in cultured RPE1 cells. Missense variations found in RPGR patients disrupt the interaction between RPGR isoforms and their endogenous interactors INPP5E, PDE6D, and RPGRIP1L. We evaluated a RPGR missense variation (M58K) found in a family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and show that this missense variation disrupts the interaction of RPGR isoforms with their endogenous interactors. The M58K variation also disrupts the ciliary localization of the RPGR1-19 isoform.

35659930,"BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein-truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Downstream of the laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data, such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that 15%-20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 45 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity plus 223 with concordant evidence in favor of benignity; these are particularly likely to be classified as likely pathogenic and likely benign, respectively, once human observational data become available.",PS3,NM_007294.4:c.121C>A,Reported by two calibrated studies to affect protein function similar to pathogenic control variants.,,1,"Gene: BRCA1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr17_43115739_G_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr17_41267756_G_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.43115739G>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.41267756G>T, rsID: rs1060502353, HGVSc: c.121C>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.His41Asn, HGVSp (1-letter): p.H41N"
38417439,"Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in BRCA2 are a common result of hereditary cancer genetic testing. While more than 4,000 unique VUSs, comprised of missense or intronic variants, have been identified in BRCA2, the few missense variants now classified clinically as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are predominantly located in the region encoding the C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD). We report on functional evaluation of the influence of 462 BRCA2 missense variants affecting the DBD on DNA repair activity of BRCA2 using a homology-directed DNA double-strand break repair assay. Of these, 137 were functionally abnormal, 313 were functionally normal, and 12 demonstrated intermediate function. Comparisons with other functional studies of BRCA2 missense variants yielded strong correlations. Sequence-based in silico prediction models had high sensitivity, but limited specificity, relative to the homology-directed repair assay. Combining the functional results with clinical and genetic data in an American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)-like variant classification framework from a clinical testing laboratory, after excluding known splicing variants and functionally intermediate variants, classified 431 of 442 (97.5%) missense variants (129 as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 302 as benign/likely benign). Functionally abnormal variants classified as pathogenic by ACMG/AMP rules were associated with a slightly lower risk of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 5.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.43-7.83) than BRCA2 DBD protein truncating variants (OR 8.56, 95% CI 6.03-12.36).

Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants.

We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15-26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479-3216.

Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs.

METHODS: The entire coding regions of the α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Functional characterization of the mutant IDUA was determined by transient transfection of the construct into COS-7 cells.
RESULTS: Mutation analyses revealed that the MPS IH patient was homozygous for a previously reported mutation, c.252insC, while the MPS IS patient was found to harbor a novel c.826G>A (p.E276K) mutation. The novel p.E276K mutation was not detected in 100 unaffected ethnic-matched control chromosomes. In addition, the glutamic acid residue at codon 276 was located at a well conserved residue.

In this report, we have identified nine mutations in human ND1 that are reported to be pathogenic and are located at subunit interfaces. Our hypothesis was that these mutations would disrupt Complex I assembly. Seventeen mutations were constructed in the homologous nuoH gene in an E. coli model system. In addition to the clinical mutations, alanine substitutions were constructed in order to distinguish between a deleterious effect from the introduction of the mutant residue and the loss of the original residue. The mutations were moved to an expression vector containing all thirteen genes of the E. coli nuo operon coding for Complex I. Membrane vesicles were prepared and rates of deamino-NADH oxidase activity and proton translocation were measured. Samples were also tested for assembly by native gel electrophoresis and for expression of NuoH by immunoblotting.

20926450,"Somatic and germline mutations in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) are found in sporadic cancers and Cowden syndrome patients, respectively. Recent identification of naturally occurring cancer and germline mutations within the ATP-binding motifs of PTEN (heretofore referred to as PTEN ATP-binding mutations) has revealed that these mutations disrupted the subcellular localization and tumor-suppressor activity of PTEN. However, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms of PTEN ATP-binding mutations in tumorigenesis. Here we show that these mutations impair PTEN's function both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the one hand, PTEN ATP-binding mutants lose their phosphatase activity and the effect of downregulation of cyclin D1. On the other, the mislocalized mutant PTEN results in a significantly decreased nuclear p53 protein level and transcriptional activity, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, induction of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase as well as dramatically increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). When compared with wild-type PTEN, the ATP-binding mutant PTEN has reduced half-life in vitro and decreased protein expression levels in vivo. Our data, thus, reveal a novel mechanism of tumorigenesis in patients with germline or somatic mutations affecting PTEN ATP-binding motifs, i.e. qualitative and quantitative impairment of PTEN due to the loss of its phosphatase activity, and nuclear mislocalization, resulting in rapid PTEN protein degradation, suppression of p53-mediated transcriptional activity, loss of protection against oxidative stress as well as accumulation of spontaneous DNA DSBs.",PS3_moderate,NM_000314.8:c.373A>G,Multiple functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product,,1,"Gene: PTEN, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr10_87933132_A_G, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr10_89692889_A_G, HGVSg (hg38): g.87933132A>G, HGVSg (hg37): g.89692889A>G, rsID: rs1554898127, HGVSc: c.373A>G, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Lys125Glu, HGVSp (1-letter): p.K125E"

Here, we show evidence of upregulated proteasome activity in PHTS-derived lymphoblasts, Pten knock-in mice and cell lines expressing missense and nonsense PTEN mutations.

Treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was able to restore both nonsense and missense mutant PTEN protein levels in vitro. PHTS patients with destabilizing PTEN mutations and proteasome hyperactivity are more susceptible to develop neurologic symptoms such as mental retardation and autism than mutation-positive patients with normal proteasome activity. A detailed molecular and functional analysis shows that PTEN mutants most likely cause proteasome hyperactivity via 2 different mechanisms, namely, induction of proteotoxic stress and loss of protein phosphatase activity.

29264392,"OBJECTIVE: To provide new insights into the interpretation of genetic variants in a rare neurologic disorder, CDKL5 deficiency, in the contexts of population sequencing data and an updated characterization of the CDKL5 gene.
METHODS: We analyzed all known potentially pathogenic CDKL5 variants by combining data from large-scale population sequencing studies with CDKL5 variants from new and all available clinical cohorts and combined this with computational methods to predict pathogenicity.
RESULTS: The study has identified several variants that can be reclassified as benign or likely benign. With the addition of novel CDKL5 variants, we confirm that pathogenic missense variants cluster in the catalytic domain of CDKL5 and reclassify a purported missense variant as having a splicing consequence. We provide further evidence that missense variants in the final 3 exons are likely to be benign and not important to disease pathology. We also describe benign splicing and nonsense variants within these exons, suggesting that isoform hCDKL5_5 is likely to have little or no neurologic significance. We also use the available data to make a preliminary estimate of minimum incidence of CDKL5 deficiency.

29451064,"Inactivation is an intrinsic property of numerous voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels and can occur by N-type or/and C-type mechanisms. N-type inactivation is a fast, voltage independent process, coupled to activation, with each inactivation particle of a tetrameric channel acting independently. In N-type inactivation, a single inactivation particle is necessary and sufficient to occlude the pore. C-type inactivation is a slower process, involving the outermost region of the pore and is mediated by a concerted, highly cooperative interaction between all four subunits. Inactivation of Kv7.1 channels does not exhibit the hallmarks of N- and C-type inactivation. Inactivation of WT Kv7.1 channels can be revealed by hooked tail currents that reflects the recovery from a fast and voltage-independent inactivation process. However, several Kv7.1 mutants such as the pore mutant L273F generate an additional voltage-dependent slow inactivation. The subunit interactions during this slow inactivation gating remain unexplored. The goal of the present study was to study the nature of subunit interactions along Kv7.1 inactivation gating, using concatenated tetrameric Kv7.1 channel and introducing sequentially into each of the four subunits the slow inactivating pore mutation L273F. Incorporating an incremental number of inactivating mutant subunits did not affect the inactivation kinetics but slowed down the recovery kinetics from inactivation. Results indicate that Kv7.1 inactivation gating is not compatible with a concerted cooperative process. Instead, adding an inactivating subunit L273F into the Kv7.1 tetramer incrementally stabilizes the inactivated state, which suggests that like for activation gating, Kv7.1 slow inactivation gating is not a concerted process.",PS3,NM_000218.3:c.817C>T,"This variant has been shown to disrupt KCNQ1 function in at least five experimental assays, including Manual patch-clamp and Experimental/Structural/Functional Simulation.",,1,"Gene: KCNQ1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr11_2572882_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr11_2594112_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.2572882C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.2594112C>T, rsID: rs120074180, HGVSc: c.817C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Leu273Phe, HGVSp (1-letter): p.L273F"
29167462,"In voltage-activated ion channels, voltage sensor (VSD) activation induces pore opening via VSD-pore coupling. Previous studies show that the pore in KCNQ1 channels opens when the VSD activates to both intermediate and fully activated states, resulting in the intermediate open (IO) and activated open (AO) states, respectively. It is also well known that accompanying KCNQ1 channel opening, the ionic current is suppressed by a rapid process called inactivation. Here we show that inactivation of KCNQ1 channels derives from the different mechanisms of the VSD-pore coupling that lead to the IO and AO states, respectively. When the VSD activates from the intermediate state to the activated state, the VSD-pore coupling has less efficacy in opening the pore, producing inactivation. These results indicate that different mechanisms, other than the canonical VSD-pore coupling, are at work in voltage-dependent ion channel activation.",PS3,NM_000218.3:c.817C>T,"This variant has been shown to disrupt KCNQ1 function in at least five experimental assays, including Manual patch-clamp and Experimental/Structural/Functional Simulation.",,1,"Gene: KCNQ1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr11_2572882_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr11_2594112_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.2572882C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.2594112C>T, rsID: rs120074180, HGVSc: c.817C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Leu273Phe, HGVSp (1-letter): p.L273F"
29021305,"BACKGROUND: An emerging standard-of-care for long-QT syndrome uses clinical genetic testing to identify genetic variants of the KCNQ1 potassium channel. However, interpreting results from genetic testing is confounded by the presence of variants of unknown significance for which there is inadequate evidence of pathogenicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we curated from the literature a high-quality set of 107 functionally characterized KCNQ1 variants. Based on this data set, we completed a detailed quantitative analysis on the sequence conservation patterns of subdomains of KCNQ1 and the distribution of pathogenic variants therein. We found that conserved subdomains generally are critical for channel function and are enriched with dysfunctional variants. Using this experimentally validated data set, we trained a neural network, designated Q1VarPred, specifically for predicting the functional impact of KCNQ1 variants of unknown significance. The estimated predictive performance of Q1VarPred in terms of Matthew's correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.581 and 0.884, respectively, superior to the performance of 8 previous methods tested in parallel. Q1VarPred is publicly available as a web server at http://meilerlab.org/q1varpred.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a plethora of tools are available for making pathogenicity predictions over a genome-wide scale, previous tools fail to perform in a robust manner when applied to KCNQ1. The contrasting and favorable results for Q1VarPred suggest a promising approach, where a machine-learning algorithm is tailored to a specific protein target and trained with a functionally validated data set to calibrate informatics tools.",PS3,NM_000218.3:c.817C>T,"This variant has been shown to disrupt KCNQ1 function in at least five experimental assays, including Manual patch-clamp and Experimental/Structural/Functional Simulation.",,1,"Gene: KCNQ1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr11_2572882_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr11_2594112_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.2572882C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.2594112C>T, rsID: rs120074180, HGVSc: c.817C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Leu273Phe, HGVSp (1-letter): p.L273F"
11278406,"KCNQ1 inactivation bears electrophysiological characteristics different from classical N- and C-type inactivation in Shaker-like potassium channels. However, the molecular site of KCNQ1 inactivation has not yet been determined. KCNQ2 channels do not exert a fast inactivation in contrast to KCNQ1 channels. By expressing functional chimeras between KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 in Xenopus oocytes, we mapped the region of this inactivation to transmembrane domain S5 and the pore loop H5 and finally narrowed down the site to positions Gly(272) and Val(307) in KCNQ1. Exchanging these two amino acids individually with the analogous KCNQ2 residue abolished inactivation. Furthermore, a KCNQ1-like inactivation was introduced into KCNQ2 by mutagenesis in the corresponding region, confirming its relevance for the inactivation process. As KCNQ1 inactivation involves the regions S5 and H5, it exhibits a geography distinct from N- or C-type inactivation. Native cardiac I(Ks) channels comprising KCNQ1 and accessory MinK subunits do not inactivate because of the functional interaction of KCNQ1 with MinK. Mutations in KCNQ1 can lead to long QT1 syndrome, an inherited form of arrhythmia. The long QT1 mutant KCNQ1(L273F) displays a pronounced KCNQ1 inactivation. Here we show that when expressing mutant I(Ks) channels formed from KCNQ1(L273F) and MinK, MinK association no longer eliminates KCNQ1 inactivation. This results in smaller repolarizing currents in the heart and therefore represents a novel mechanism leading to long QT syndrome.",PS3,NM_000218.3:c.817C>T,"This variant has been shown to disrupt KCNQ1 function in at least five experimental assays, including Manual patch-clamp and Experimental/Structural/Functional Simulation.",,1,"Gene: KCNQ1, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr11_2572882_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr11_2594112_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.2572882C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.2594112C>T, rsID: rs120074180, HGVSc: c.817C>T, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Leu273Phe, HGVSp (1-letter): p.L273F"
22456477,"BACKGROUND: β-Adrenergic stimulation is the main trigger for cardiac events in type 1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1). We evaluated a possible association between ion channel response to β-adrenergic stimulation and clinical response to β-blocker therapy according to mutation location.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study sample comprised 860 patients with genetically confirmed mutations in the KCNQ1 channel. Patients were categorized into carriers of missense mutations located in the cytoplasmic loops (C loops), membrane-spanning domain, C/N terminus, and nonmissense mutations. There were 27 aborted cardiac arrest and 78 sudden cardiac death events from birth through 40 years of age. After multivariable adjustment for clinical factors, the presence of C-loop mutations was associated with the highest risk for aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio versus nonmissense mutations=2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-5.86; P=0.009). β-Blocker therapy was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the risk of aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death among patients with C-loop mutations than among all other patients (hazard ratio=0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.73; P=0.02; and hazard ratio=0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-2.13; P=0.68, respectively; P for interaction=0.04). Cellular expression studies showed that membrane spanning and C-loop mutations produced a similar decrease in current, but only C-loop mutations showed a pronounced reduction in channel activation in response to β-adrenergic stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with C-loop missense mutations in the KCNQ1 channel exhibit a high risk for life-threatening events and derive a pronounced benefit from treatment with β-blockers.

For disorders caused by mutations in cardiac ion channels as in congenital arrhythmia syndromes, in vitro electrophysiological evidence has high value in discriminating pathogenic from benign variants, but these data are often lacking because assays are cost, time, and labor intensive.
METHODS: We implemented a strategy for performing high-throughput functional evaluations of ion channel variants that repurposed an automated electrophysiological recording platform developed previously for drug discovery.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the success of this approach by evaluating 78 variants in KCNQ1, a major gene involved in genetic disorders of cardiac arrhythmia susceptibility. We benchmarked our results with traditional electrophysiological approaches and observed a high level of concordance. This strategy also enabled studies of dominant-negative behavior of variants exhibiting severe loss-of-function. Overall, our results provided functional data useful for reclassifying >65% of the studied KCNQ1 variants.

17999538,"Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial potassium channels and the closed state model for Kv1.2 of Yarov-Yarovoy et al. ((2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 7292-7207). Using the new models for KCNQ1, we generated a database for the location and predicted residue-residue interactions for more than 85 disease-linked sites in both open and closed states. These data can be used to generate structure-based hypotheses for disease phenotypes associated with each mutation. The potential utility of these models and the database is exemplified by the surprising observation that four of the five known mutations in KCNQ1 that are associated with gain-of-function KCNQ1 defects are predicted to share a common interface in the open state structure between the S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit.

25344363,"AIMS: Long QT syndrome 1 (LQT1) mutations in KCNQ1 that decrease cardiac IKs (slowly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current) underlie ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. LQT1 mutations may suppress IKs by preventing KCNQ1 assembly, disrupting surface trafficking, or inhibiting gating. We investigated mechanisms underlying how three LQT1 mutations in KCNQ1 C-terminus assembly domain (R555H/G589D/L619M) decrease IKs in heterologous cells and cardiomyocytes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mutant KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels either produced no currents (G589D/L619M) or displayed markedly reduced IKs with a right-shifted voltage-dependence of activation (R555H). When co-expressed with wild-type (wt) KCNQ1, the mutant KCNQ1s displayed varying intrinsic dominant-negative capacities that were affected by auxiliary KCNE1. All three mutant KCNQ1s assembled with wt KCNQ1 as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We developed an optical quantum dot labelling assay to measure channel surface density. G589D/R555H displayed substantial reductions in surface density, which were either partially (G589D) or fully (R555H) rescued by wt KCNQ1. Unexpectedly, L619M showed no trafficking defect. In adult rat cardiomyocytes, adenovirus-expressed homotetrameric G589D/L619M + KCNE1 channels yielded no currents, whereas R555H + KCNE1 produced diminished IKs with a right-shifted voltage-dependence of activation, mimicking observations in CHO cells. In contrast to heterologous cells, homotetrameric R555H channels showed no trafficking defect in cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSION: Distinct LQT1 mutations in KCNQ1 assembly domain decrease IKs using unique combinations of biophysical and trafficking mechanisms. Functional deficits in IKs observed in heterologous cells are mostly, but not completely, recapitulated in adult rat cardiomyocytes.

With the increased availability and affordability of genetic testing, many individuals have been identified with BRCA1 variants of uncertain significance (VUSs), which are individually detected in the population too infrequently to ascertain a clinical risk. Functional assays can be used to experimentally assess the effects of these variants. In this study, we used multiplexed DNA repair assays of variants in the BRCA1 carboxyl terminus to functionally characterize 2,271 variants for homology-directed repair function (HDR) and 1,427 variants for cisplatin resistance (CR). We found a high level of consistent results (Pearson's r = 0.74) in the two multiplexed functional assays with non-functional variants located within regions of the BRCA1 protein necessary for its tumor suppression activity. In addition, functional categorizations of variants tested in the multiplex HDR and CR assays correlated with known clinical significance and with other functional assays for BRCA1 (Pearson's r = 0.53 to 0.71).

We have identified a novel mutation of the splice donor site of intron 1 in the noncoding region of BRCA2 in a Japanese FA family. This mutation may account for the FA phenotype in a patient originally reported to have biallelic mutations in BRCA2. Subsequent functional studies revealed that one of the mutations, K2729N, was a neutral change. As reported here, a more careful analysis resulted in the identification of a novel splice site mutation. Functional analysis using a mouse embryonic stem cell-based assay revealed that it causes aberrant splicing, reduced transcript levels and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, suggesting that it is likely to be pathogenic.

The cilia-expressed gene RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) is mutated in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and encodes multiple protein isoforms with a common N-terminal domain homologous to regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ran GTPase. RPGR interacts with several ciliopathy proteins, such as RPGRIP1L and CEP290; however, its physiological role in cilia-associated functions has not been delineated. Here, we report that RPGR interacts with the small GTPase RAB8A, which participates in cilia biogenesis and maintenance. We show that RPGR primarily associates with the GDP-bound form of RAB8A and stimulates GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange. Disease-causing mutations in RPGR diminish its interaction with RAB8A and reduce the GEF activity. Depletion of RPGR in hTERT-RPE1 cells interferes with ciliary localization of RAB8A and results in shorter primary cilia. Our data suggest that RPGR modulates intracellular localization and function of RAB8A.

29044175,"Pompe disease is caused by an inborn defect of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and is characterized by lysosomal glycogen accumulation primarily in the skeletal muscle and heart. Patients with the severe type of the disease, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), show generalized muscle weakness and heart failure in early infancy. They cannot survive over two years. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves the survival rate, but its effect on skeletal muscle is insufficient compared to other organs. Moreover, the patho-mechanism of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD is still unclear. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with IOPD and differentiated them into myocytes. Differentiated myocytes showed lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which was dose-dependently rescued by rhGAA. We further demonstrated that mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity was impaired in IOPD iPSC-derived myocytes. Comprehensive metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested the disturbance of mTORC1-related signaling, including deteriorated energy status and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative function. In summary, we successfully established an in vitro skeletal muscle model of IOPD using patient-specific iPSCs.

Disease-causing mutations have been reported in five genes, each encoding a protein component of the sarcomeric thin filament. Recently, we identified mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal-actin gene (ACTA1) in a subset of patients with NM. In the present study, we evaluated a new series of 35 patients with NM. We identified five novel missense mutations in ACTA1, which suggested that mutations in muscle alpha-skeletal actin account for the disease in approximately 15% of patients with NM. The mutations appeared de novo and represent new dominant mutations. One proband subsequently had two affected children, a result consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. The seven patients exhibited marked clinical variability, ranging from severe congenital-onset weakness, with death from respiratory failure during the 1st year of life, to a mild childhood-onset myopathy, with survival into adulthood. There was marked variation in both age at onset and clinical severity in the three affected members of one family. Common pathological features included abnormal fiber type differentiation, glycogen accumulation, myofibrillar disruption, and ""whorling"" of actin thin filaments. The percentage of fibers with rods did not correlate with clinical severity; however, the severe, lethal phenotype was associated with both severe, generalized disorganization of sarcomeric structure and abnormal localization of sarcomeric actin. The marked variability, in clinical phenotype, among patients with different mutations in ACTA1 suggests that both the site of the mutation and the nature of the amino acid change have differential effects on thin-filament formation and protein-protein interactions.

Mutations in the gene encoding RS1 are responsible for X-linked retinoschisis, a retinal degenerative disease characterized by the splitting of the retinal cell layers and visual impairment. To better understand the role of RS1 in retinal cell biology and X-linked retinoschisis, we have studied the interaction of wild-type and mutant RS1 with various carbohydrates coupled to agarose supports. RS1 bound efficiently to galactose-agarose and to a lesser extent lactose-agarose, but not agarose, N-acetylgalactosamine-agarose, N-acetylglucosamine-agarose, mannose-agarose, or heparin-agarose. RS1 cysteine mutants (C59S/C223S and C59S/C223S/C40S) which prevent disulfide-linked octamer formation exhibited little if any binding to galactose-agarose. The disease-causing R141H mutant bound galactose-agarose at levels similar to that of wild-type RS1, whereas the R141S mutant resulted in a marked reduction in the level of galactose-agarose binding. RS1 bound to galactose-agarose could be effectively displaced by incubation with isopropyl beta- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). This property was used as a basis to develop an efficient purification procedure.

Our data revealed that both the FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-like domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of AIPL1 are required for interaction with HSP90. We further demonstrate that AIPL1 significantly modulates the catalytic activity of heterologously expressed rod PDE6. Although the N-terminal FKBP-like domain of AIPL1 binds the farnesylated PDE6α subunit through direct interaction with the farnesyl moiety, mutations compromising the integrity of the C-terminal TPR domain of AIPL1 also failed to modulate PDE6 activity efficiently.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is hypothesized to be a conformational disease, with loss of function due to protein destabilization, and the restoration of enzyme function that is observed in BH(4) treatment might be transmitted by correction of protein misfolding. To elucidate the molecular basis of functional impairment in PAH deficiency, we investigated the impact of ten PAH gene mutations identified in patients with BH(4)-responsiveness on enzyme kinetics, stability, and conformation of the protein (F55L, I65S, H170Q, P275L, A300S, S310Y, P314S, R408W, Y414C, Y417H). Residual enzyme activity was generally high, but allostery was disturbed in almost all cases and pointed to altered protein conformation. This was confirmed by reduced proteolytic stability, impaired tetramer assembly or aggregation, increased hydrophobicity, and accelerated thermal unfolding--with particular impact on the regulatory domain--observed in most variants. Three-dimensional modeling revealed the involvement of functionally relevant amino acid networks that may communicate misfolding throughout the protein. Our results substantiate the view that PAH deficiency is a protein-misfolding disease in which global conformational changes hinder molecular motions essential for physiological enzyme function.

38651838,"SCN2A-related disorders secondary to altered function in the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 are rare, with clinically heterogeneous expressions that include epilepsy, autism and multiple severe to profound impairments and other conditions. To advance understanding of the clinical phenotypes and their relationship to channel function, 81 patients (36 female, 44%, median age 5.4 years) with 69 unique SCN2A variants were systematically phenotyped and their Nav1.2 channel function systematically assessed. Participants were recruited through the FamileSCN2A Foundation. Primary phenotype (epilepsy of neonatal onset, n = 27; infant onset, n = 18; and later onset n = 24; and autism without seizures, n = 12) was strongly correlated with a non-seizure severity index (P = 0.002), which was based on presence of severe impairments in gross motor, fine motor, communication abilities, gastrostomy tube dependence and diagnosis of cortical visual impairment and scoliosis. Non-seizure severity was greatest in the neonatal-onset group and least in the autism group (P = 0.002). Children with the lowest severity indices were still severely impaired, as reflected by an average Vineland Adaptive Behavior composite score of 49.5 (>3 standard deviations below the norm-referenced mean of the test). Epileptic spasms were significantly more common in infant-onset (67%) than in neonatal (22%) or later-onset (29%) epilepsy (P = 0.007). Primary phenotype was also strongly correlated with variant function (P < 0.0001); gain-of-function and mixed function variants predominated in neonatal-onset epilepsy, shifting to moderate loss of function in infant-onset epilepsy and to severe and complete loss of function in later-onset epilepsy and autism groups. Exploratory cluster analysis identified five groups, representing: (i) primarily later-onset epilepsy with moderate loss-of-function variants and low severity indices; (ii) mostly infant-onset epilepsy with moderate loss-of-function variants but higher severity indices; and (iii) late-onset and autism only, with the lowest severity indices (mostly zero) and severe/complete loss-of-function variants. Two exclusively neonatal clusters were distinguished from each other largely on non-seizure severity scores and secondarily on variant function. The relationship between primary phenotype and variant function emphasizes the role of developmental factors in the differential clinical expression of SCN2A variants based on their effects on Nav1.2 channel function. The non-seizure severity of SCN2A disorders depends on a combination of the age at seizure onset (primary phenotype) and variant function.

37578743,"Pathogenic variants in voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel genes including SCN2A, encoding NaV1.2, are discovered frequently in neurodevelopmental disorders with or without epilepsy. SCN2A is also a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID). Previous work to determine the functional consequences of SCN2A variants yielded a paradigm in which predominantly gain-of-function variants cause neonatal-onset epilepsy, whereas loss-of-function variants are associated with ASD and ID. However, this framework was derived from a limited number of studies conducted under heterogeneous experimental conditions, whereas most disease-associated SCN2A variants have not been functionally annotated. We determined the functional properties of SCN2A variants using automated patch-clamp recording to demonstrate the validity of this method and to examine whether a binary classification of variant dysfunction is evident in a larger cohort studied under uniform conditions. We studied 28 disease-associated variants and 4 common variants using two alternatively spliced isoforms of NaV1.2 expressed in HEK293T cells. Automated patch-clamp recording provided a valid high throughput method to ascertain detailed functional properties of NaV1.2 variants with concordant findings for variants that were previously studied using manual patch clamp. Many epilepsy-associated variants in our study exhibited complex patterns of gain- and loss-of-functions that are difficult to classify by a simple binary scheme.

29648639,"Six pathogenic mutations have been reported in human mitochondrial tRNAThr (hmtRNAThr); however, the pathogenic molecular mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we established an activity assay system for human mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (hmThrRS). In the present study, we surveyed the structural and enzymatic effects of pathogenic mutations in hmtRNAThr and then focused on m.15915 G > A (G30A) and m.15923A > G (A38G). The harmful evolutionary gain of non-Watson-Crick base pair A29/C41 caused hmtRNAThr to be highly susceptible to mutations disrupting the G30-C40 base pair in various ways; for example, structural integrity maintenance, modification and aminoacylation of tRNAThr, and editing mischarged tRNAThr. A similar phenomenon was observed for hmtRNATrp with an A29/C41 non-Watson-Crick base pair, but not in bovine mtRNAThr with a natural G29-C41 base pair. The A38G mutation caused a severe reduction in Thr-acceptance and editing of hmThrRS. Importantly, A38 is a nucleotide determinant for the t6A modification at A37, which is essential for the coding properties of hmtRNAThr. In summary, our results revealed the crucial role of the G30-C40 base pair in maintaining the proper structure and function of hmtRNAThr because of A29/C41 non-Watson-Crick base pair and explained the molecular outcome of pathogenic G30A and A38G mutations.",PS3_supporting,NC_012920.1:m.15915G>A,"Functional characterization of the mutant tRNA suggest the variant changes the tRNA conformation, reduces the stability of the tRNA, reduces charging capacity of the tRNA, and affects modification of the tRNA",,1,"Gene: , chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chrM_15915_G_A, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chrM_15916_G_A, HGVSg (hg38): g.N/A, HGVSg (hg37): g.N/A, rsID: N/A, HGVSc: N/A, HGVSp (3-letter): N/A, HGVSp (1-letter): N/A"

20161772,"Inherited cardiomyopathy (CM) represents a diverse group of cardiac muscle diseases that present with a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from benign to highly malignant. Contributing to this genetic complexity and clinical heterogeneity is the emergence of a cohort of patients that are double or compound heterozygotes who have inherited two different CM mutant alleles in the same or different sarcomeric gene. These patients typically have early disease onset with worse clinical outcomes. Little experimental attention has been directed towards elucidating the physiologic basis of double CM mutations at the cellular-molecular level. Here, dual gene transfer to isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes was used to determine the primary effects of co-expressing two different CM-linked mutant proteins on intact cardiac myocyte contractile physiology. Dual expression of two CM mutants, that alone moderately increase myofilament activation, tropomyosin mutant A63V and cardiac troponin mutant R146G, were shown to additively slow myocyte relaxation beyond either mutant studied in isolation. These results were qualitatively similar to a combination of moderate and strong activating CM mutant alleles alphaTmA63V and cTnI R193H, which approached a functional threshold. Interestingly, a combination of a CM myofilament deactivating mutant, troponin C G159D, together with an activating mutant, cTnIR193H, produced a hybrid phenotype that blunted the strong activating phenotype of cTnIR193H alone. This is evidence of neutralizing effects of activating/deactivating mutant alleles in combination.

22675533,"The contractile response of the heart can be altered by disease-related protein modifications to numerous contractile proteins. By utilizing an IAANS labeled fluorescent troponin C, [Formula: see text], we examined the effects of ten disease-related troponin modifications on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the troponin complex and the reconstituted thin filament. The selected modifications are associated with a broad range of cardiac diseases: three subtypes of familial cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive) and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consistent with previous studies, the majority of the protein modifications had no effect on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the isolated troponin complex. However, when incorporated into the thin filament, dilated cardiomyopathy mutations desensitized (up to 3.3-fold), while hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy mutations, and ischemia-induced truncation of troponin I, sensitized the thin filament to Ca(2+) (up to 6.3-fold). Kinetically, the dilated cardiomyopathy mutations increased the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from the thin filament (up to 2.5-fold), while the hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy mutations, and the ischemia-induced truncation of troponin I decreased the rate (up to 2-fold). The protein modifications also increased (up to 5.4-fold) or decreased (up to 2.5-fold) the apparent rate of Ca(2+) association to the thin filament. Thus, the disease-related protein modifications alter Ca(2+) binding by influencing both the association and dissociation rates of thin filament Ca(2+) exchange. These alterations in Ca(2+) exchange kinetics influenced the response of the thin filament to artificial Ca(2+) transients generated in a stopped-flow apparatus. Troponin C may act as a hub, sensing physiological and pathological stimuli to modulate the Ca(2+)-binding properties of the thin filament and influence the contractile performance of the heart.",PS3_moderate,NM_000363.5:c.575G>A,Functional studies have been reported and are sufficient to apply PS3_Moderate,,1,"Gene: TNNI3, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_55151892_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_55663260_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.55151892C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.55663260C>T, rsID: rs104894729, HGVSc: c.575G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg192His, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R192H"
19289050,"We examined four cardiomyopathy-causing mutations of troponin I that appear to disturb function by altering the distribution of thin filament states. The R193H (mouse) troponin I mutant had greater than normal actin-activated myosin-S1 ATPase activity in both the presence and absence of calcium. The rate of ATPase activity was the same as that of the wild-type at near-saturating concentrations of the activator, N-ethylmaleimide-S1. This mutant appeared to function by stabilizing the active state of thin filaments. Mutations D191H, R146G, and R146W had lower ATPase activities in the presence of calcium, but higher activities in the absence of calcium. These effects were most pronounced with mutations at position 146. For all three mutants the rates were similar to those of the wild-type at near-saturating concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide-S1. These results, combined with previous results, show that any alteration in the normal distribution of actomyosin states is capable of producing cardiomyopathy. The results of the D191H, R146G, and R146W mutations are most readily explained if the intermediate state of regulated actin has a unique function.

The physiological effect of cTnI, as an inhibitory subunit of troponin complex, is to prevent the interaction between myosin heavy chain heads and actins, i.e. the cross-bridge formation, and to ensure a proper relaxation of cardiac myofilaments. In pathological conditions, the deficiency of cTnI or mutations in cTnI especially in the C-terminus of cTnI is associated with diastolic dysfunction caused by myofibril hypersensitivity to Ca2+. Our laboratory has generated cTnI knockout mouse model to investigate the cellular and molecular function of cTnI and created cTnI mutant disease mouse models to explore the pathophysiology caused by cTnI mutations in the heart. Here, we present our recent studies on physiological function of cTnI in the heart and the pathological consequences caused by the cTnI mutations in the diseased heart using the transgenic mouse models.

To determine whether five mutations in cTnI (L144Q, R145W, A171T, K178E, and R192H) associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy were distinguishable from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in cTnI, actomyosin ATPase activity and skinned fiber studies were carried out. All five mutations investigated showed an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with wild-type cTnI. The two mutations with the worst clinical phenotype (K178E and R192H) both showed large increases in Ca2+ sensitivity (deltapCa50 = 0.47 and 0.36, respectively).

Three mutants (L144Q, R145W, and K178E) were unable to fully relax contraction in the absence of Ca2+. The inability of the five cTnI mutations investigated to fully inhibit ATPase activity/force development and the generally larger increases in Ca2+ sensitivity than observed for most hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations would likely lead to severe diastolic dysfunction and may be the major physiological factors responsible for causing the restrictive cardiomyopathy phenotype in some of the genetically affected individuals.",PS3_moderate,NM_000363.5:c.575G>A,Functional studies have been reported and are sufficient to apply PS3_Moderate,,1,"Gene: TNNI3, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr19_55151892_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr19_55663260_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.55151892C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.55663260C>T, rsID: rs104894729, HGVSc: c.575G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Arg192His, HGVSp (1-letter): p.R192H"

We investigated R145G and R145W mutations from the inhibitory region and D190H and R192H mutations from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site. Each of the four mutations sensitized the acto-S1 ATPase to Ca2+. Whereas the mutations from the inhibitory region increased the basal level of ATPase activity, those from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site did not. The effects on the Ca2+ binding properties of the troponin ternary complex and the troponin-tropomyosin complex with one of four mutations were either desensitization or no effect compared with those with wild-type cTnI. All of the mutations, however, affected the Ca2+ sensitivities of the reconstituted thin filaments in the same direction as the acto-S1 ATPase activity. Also the thin filaments with one of the mutant cTnIs bound Ca2+ with less cooperativity compared with those with wild-type cTnI. These data indicate that the mutations found in the inhibitory region and those from the second actin-tropomyosin site shift the equilibrium of the states of the thin filaments differently.

Mutations F110I, E244D, and COOH-terminal truncation weakened the affinity of troponin for the thin filament. Mutation DeltaE160 resulted in thin filaments with increased calcium affinity at the regulatory site of troponin C. Mutations R92Q and F110I resulted in impaired troponin solubility, suggesting abnormal protein folding. Depending upon the mutation, the in vitro unloaded actin-myosin sliding speed showed small increases, showed small decreases, or was unchanged. COOH-terminal truncation mutation resulted in a decreased thin filament-myosin subfragment 1 MgATPase rate. The results indicate that the mutations cause diverse immediate effects, despite similarities in disease manifestations. Separable but repeatedly observed abnormalities resulting from FHC TnT mutations include increased unloaded sliding speed, increased or decreased Ca(2+) affinity, impairment of folding or sarcomeric integrity, and decreased force.

22579624,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is one of the most common genetic causes of heart disease. Approximately 15% of FHC-related mutations are found in cTnT [cardiac troponin (cTn) T]. Most of the cTnT FHC-related mutations are in or flanking the N-tail TNT1 domain that directly interacts with overlapping tropomyosin (Tm). We investigate two sets of cTnT mutations at opposite ends of TNT1, mutations in residue 92 in the Tm-Tm overlap region of TNT1 and mutations in residues 160 and 163 in the C-terminal portion of TNT1 adjacent to the cTnT H1-H2 linker. Though all the mutations are located within TNT1, they have widely different phenotypes clinically and biophysically. Using a complete atomistic model of the cTn-Tm complex, we identify mechanisms by which the effects of TNT1 mutations propagate to the cTn core and site II of cTnC, where calcium binding and dissociation occurs. We find that mutations in TNT1 alter the flexibility of TNT1, which is inversely proportional to the cooperativity of calcium activation of the thin filament. Further, we identify a pathway of propagation of structural and dynamic changes from TNT1 to site II of cTnC, including TNT1, cTnT linker, I-T arm, regulatory domain of cTnI, the D-E linker of cTnC, and site II cTnC. Mutationally induced changes at site II of cTnC alter calcium coordination that corresponds to biophysical measurements of calcium sensitivity.

24480310,"The majority of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in (cTnT) occur within the alpha-helical tropomyosin binding TNT1 domain. A highly charged region at the C-terminal end of TNT1 unwinds to create a flexible ""hinge"". While this region has not been structurally resolved, it likely acts as an extended linker between the two cTnT functional domains. Mutations in this region cause phenotypically diverse and often severe forms of HCM. Mechanistic insight, however, has been limited by the lack of structural information. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated the effects of cTnT 160-163 mutations using regulated in vitro motility (R-IVM) assays and transgenic mouse models. R-IVM revealed that cTnT mutations Δ160E, E163R and E163K disrupted weak electrostatic actomyosin binding. Reducing the ionic strength or decreasing Brownian motion rescued function. This is the first observation of HCM-linked mutations in cTnT disrupting weak interactions between the thin filament and myosin. To evaluate the in vivo effects of altering weak actomyosin binding we generated transgenic mice expressing Δ160E and E163R mutant cTnT and observed severe cardiac remodeling and profound myofilament disarray.

We used the quantitative in vitro motility assay to study Ca(2+)-regulation of unloaded movement and its modulation by troponin I phosphorylation. Troponin from a patient with the K280N TnT mutation showed no difference in Ca(2+)-sensitivity when compared with donor heart troponin and the Ca(2+)-sensitivity was also independent of the troponin I phosphorylation level (uncoupled). The recombinant K280N TnT mutation increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity 1.7-fold and was also uncoupled. The R92Q TnT mutation in troponin from transgenic mouse increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity and was also completely uncoupled. Five TnT mutations (Δ14, Δ28 + 7, ΔE160, S179F and K273E) studied in recombinant troponin increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity and were all fully uncoupled. Thus, for HCM-causing mutations in TnT, Ca(2+)-sensitisation together with uncoupling in vitro is the usual response and both factors may contribute to the HCM phenotype. We also found that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can restore coupling to all uncoupled HCM-causing TnT mutations.

The actin mutation caused a higher Ca(2+) sensitivity in reconstituted thin filaments measured by in vitro motility assay (2.3-fold for mice and 1.3-fold for humans) and in skinned papillary muscle. The mutation also abolished the change in Ca(2+) sensitivity normally linked to troponin I phosphorylation. MyBP-C and troponin I phosphorylation levels were the same as controls in transgenic mice and human carrier heart samples. ACTC E99K mice exhibited a high death rate between 28 and 45 days (48% females and 22% males). At 21 weeks, the hearts of the male survivors had enlarged atria, increased interstitial fibrosis, and sarcomere disarray. MRI showed hypertrophy, predominantly at the apex of the heart. End-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure were increased, and relaxation rates were reduced compared with nontransgenic littermates. End-systolic pressures and volumes were unaltered. ECG abnormalities were present, and the contractile response to β-adrenergic stimulation was much reduced. Older mice (29-week-old females and 38-week-old males) developed dilated cardiomyopathy with increased end-systolic volume and continuing increased end-diastolic pressure and slower contraction and relaxation rates. ECG showed atrial flutter and frequent atrial ectopic beats at rest in some ACTC E99K mice.

28658286,"The ""super-relaxed state"" (SRX) of myosin represents a 'reserve' of motors in the heart. Myosin heads in the SRX are bound to the thick filament and have a very low ATPase rate. Changes in the SRX are likely to modulate cardiac contractility. We previously demonstrated that the SRX is significantly reduced in mouse cardiomyocytes lacking cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, we report the effect of mutations in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) using samples from human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Left ventricular (LV) samples from 11 HCM patients were obtained following myectomy surgery to relieve LV outflow tract obstruction. HCM samples were genotyped as either MYBPC3 mutation positive (MYBPC3mut) or negative (HCMsmn) and were compared to eight non-failing donor hearts. Compared to donors, only MYBPC3mut samples display a significantly diminished SRX, characterised by a decrease in both the number of myosin heads in the SRX and the lifetime of ATP turnover. These changes were not observed in HCMsmn samples. There was a positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the expression of cMyBP-C and the proportion of myosin heads in the SRX state, suggesting cMyBP-C modulates and maintains the SRX. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain in MYBPC3mut samples was significantly decreased compared to the other groups, suggesting a potential mechanism to compensate for the diminished SRX. We conclude that by altering both contractility and sarcomeric energy requirements, a reduced SRX may be an important disease mechanism in patients with MYBPC3 mutations.",PS3_supporting,NM_000258.3:c.427G>A,"Functional studies, including mouse models provide some evidence that this variant impacts protein function.",,1,"Gene: MYL3, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr3_46859529_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr3_46901019_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.46859529C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.46901019C>T, rsID: rs104893750, HGVSc: c.427G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Glu143Lys, HGVSp (1-letter): p.E143K"
28371863,"AIMS: The E143K (Glu → Lys) mutation in the myosin essential light chain has been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in humans, but the mechanisms that underlie the development of defective cardiac function are unknown. Using transgenic E143K-RCM mice, we sought to determine the molecular and cellular triggers of E143K-induced heart remodelling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The E143K-induced abnormalities in cardiac function and morphology observed by echocardiography and invasive haemodynamics were paralleled by augmented active and passive tension measured in skinned papillary muscle fibres compared with wild-type (WT)-generated force. In vitro, E143K-myosin had increased duty ratio and binding affinity to actin compared with WT-myosin, increased actin-activated ATPase activity and slower rates of ATP-dependent dissociation of the acto-myosin complex, indicating an E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility. E143K was also observed to reduce the level of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation while that of troponin-I remained unchanged. Small-angle X-ray diffraction data showed a decrease in the filament lattice spacing (d1,0) with no changes in the equatorial reflections intensity ratios (I1,1/I1,0) in E143K vs. WT skinned papillary muscles. The hearts of mutant-mice demonstrated ultrastructural defects and fibrosis that progressively worsened in senescent animals and these changes were hypothesized to contribute to diastolic disturbance and to mild systolic dysfunction. Gene expression profiles of E143K-hearts supported the histopathology results and showed an upregulation of stress-response and collagen genes. Finally, proteomic analysis evidenced RCM-dependent metabolic adaptations and higher energy demands in E143K vs. WT hearts.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility, the hearts of RCM mice model exhibited cardiac dysfunction, stiff ventricles and physiological, morphologic, and metabolic remodelling consistent with the development of RCM. Future efforts should be directed toward normalization of myosin motor function and the use of myosin-specific therapeutics to avert the hypercontractile state of E143K-myosin and prevent pathological cardiac remodelling.",PS3_supporting,NM_000258.3:c.427G>A,"Functional studies, including mouse models provide some evidence that this variant impacts protein function.",,1,"Gene: MYL3, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg38): chr3_46859529_C_T, chr_pos_ref_alt (hg37): chr3_46901019_C_T, HGVSg (hg38): g.46859529C>T, HGVSg (hg37): g.46901019C>T, rsID: rs104893750, HGVSc: c.427G>A, HGVSp (3-letter): p.Glu143Lys, HGVSp (1-letter): p.E143K"
29669825,"Myosin transduces ATP free energy into mechanical work in muscle. Cardiac muscle has dynamically wide-ranging power demands on the motor as the muscle changes modes in a heartbeat from relaxation, via auxotonic shortening, to isometric contraction. The cardiac power output modulation mechanism is explored in vitro by assessing single cardiac myosin step-size selection versus load. Transgenic mice express human ventricular essential light chain (ELC) in wild- type (WT), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutant forms, A57G or E143K, in a background of mouse α-cardiac myosin heavy chain. Ensemble motility and single myosin mechanical characteristics are consistent with an A57G that impairs ELC N-terminus actin binding and an E143K that impairs lever-arm stability, while both species down-shift average step-size with increasing load. Cardiac myosin in vivo down-shifts velocity/force ratio with increasing load by changed unitary step-size selections. Here, the loaded in vitro single myosin assay indicates quantitative complementarity with the in vivo mechanism. Both have two embedded regulatory transitions, one inhibiting ADP release and a second novel mechanism inhibiting actin detachment via strain on the actin-bound ELC N-terminus.

Unexpectedly, antibody staining demonstrated incorporation of both forms of human cardiac TnT into the sarcomeres of quail myotubes. Functional studies of wild type and mutant transfected myotubes of normal appearance revealed that calcium-activated force of contraction was normal upon incorporation of wild type TnT, but greatly diminished for the mutant TnT.

9637714,"Mutations in multiple cardiac sarcomeric proteins including myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) cause a dominant genetic heart disease, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Patients with mutations in these two genes have quite distinct clinical characteristics. Those with MyHC mutations demonstrate more significant and uniform cardiac hypertrophy and a variable frequency of sudden death. Patients with cTnT mutations generally exhibit mild or no hypertrophy, but a high frequency of sudden death at an early age. To understand the basis for these distinctions and to study the pathogenesis of the disease, we have created transgenic mice expressing a truncated mouse cTnT allele analogous to one found in FHC patients. Mice expressing truncated cTnT at low (< 5%) levels develop cardiomyopathy and their hearts are significantly smaller (18-27%) than wild type. These animals also exhibit significant diastolic dysfunction and milder systolic dysfunction. Animals that express higher levels of transgene protein die within 24 h of birth. Transgenic mouse hearts demonstrate myocellular disarray and have a reduced number of cardiac myocytes that are smaller in size.

15568820,"The complex of tropomyosin and troponin binds to actin and inhibits activation of myosin ATPase activity and force production of striated muscles at low free Ca(2+) concentrations. Ca(2+) stimulates ATP activity, and at subsaturating actin concentrations, the binding of NEM-modified S1 to actin-tropomyosin-troponin increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis even further. We show here that the Delta14 mutation of troponin T, associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, results in an increase in ATPase rate like that seen with wild-type troponin in the presence of NEM-S1. The enhanced ATPase activity was not due to a decreased incorporation of mutant troponin T with troponin I and troponin C to form an active troponin complex. The activating effect was more prominent with a hybrid troponin (skeletal TnI, TnC, and cardiac TnT) than with all cardiac troponin. Thus it appears that changes in the troponin-troponin contacts that result from mutations or from forming hybrids stabilize a more active state of regulated actin.
