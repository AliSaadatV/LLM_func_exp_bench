Biochemical assays show T468M has greatly reduced phosphatase activity and weakened autoinhibitory interaction, while cell‐based assays demonstrate enhanced binding to Gab1 and sustained ERK1/2 activation under both EGF and HGF stimulation. These functional abnormalities support a GOF effect consistent with LEOPARD syndrome pathogenesis. Overall evidence supports PS3_moderate for T468M.	24935154	o4-mini					matched	medium	protein	T468M	p.Thr468Met;;p.T468M;;c.1403C>T;;chr12_112926270_C_T;;rs121918457	Abstract;;Results section listing LS-associated mutants;;Figure 1C caption;;Figure 2D caption;;Figure 6A–C captions	Matched by explicit protein change T468M in multiple sections;;Exact variant label used in figures and text	PS3	moderate		In vitro enzymatic assays and cell‐based signaling assays with WT controls, replicates, and statistical analysis	T468M shows significantly reduced catalytic activity and disrupted autoinhibition while promoting increased Gab1 binding and sustained ERK activation, consistent with GOF disease mechanism

In multiple assays, D213G assembles into a stable complex but shows a 28–54% reduction in electron transfer activity, prominent lag-phases in quinone reduction, and 30–70% of WT proton pumping. Well-controlled and replicated biochemical assays thus demonstrate a damaging functional effect. On this basis, PS3 evidence is applied at moderate strength.	34135385	o4-mini					matched	medium	protein	m.3902-3908inv7;;D199G/L200K/A201VMT-ND1;;D213GH	D199G_MT-ND1;;D213G_H	Results paragraph 1;;Methods: Site-directed mutagenesis	Human m.3902-3908inv7 inversion yields triple mutation D199G/L200K/A201V_MT-ND1; only D199G is conserved;;Paper explicitly maps human D199_MT-ND1 to E. coli D213H;;E. coli variant D213G_H used as proxy for human D199G_MT-ND1	PS3	moderate		Well-established biochemical assays with clear WT and negative controls, biological replicates, and orthogonal functional readouts	D213GH variant shows intact assembly but decreased electron transfer (46–72% of WT) and reduced proton pumping (33–70% of WT) with slowed kinetics, consistent with damaging loss-of-function; mapping to human D199G via explicit alignment

In FDB fibers and in vivo microelectrode recordings, T4826I-RYR1 shows elevated resting and evoked Ca2+ signals and heightened sensitivity to halothane. In myotubes, the variant impairs mitochondrial respiration, reduces mitochondrial content, and elevates calpain activity.

In human TM cells, the N450Y mutant fails to secrete, accumulates in the ER inducing ER stress, activates autophagy, reduces viability, and increases apoptosis relative to WT. In Tg-MYOCN450Y mice, the mutant shows absent secretion into aqueous humor and elevated ER stress and autophagy markers in ocular tissues. These functional abnormalities provide moderate-level PS3 evidence supporting a damaging effect of the N450Y variant.	35615698	o4-mini					matched	high	protein	Asn450Tyr;;N450Y;;MYOC-N450Y;;c.A1348T	p.Asn450Tyr;;p.N450Y;;c.1348A>T	Abstract;;Results section 'Non-Secretion of Mutant MYOC Induced ER Stress';;Figure 1 legend;;Figure 2 legend;;Figure 3 legend;;Figure 4 legend	Exact amino acid change p.N450Y is repeatedly used in the paper and matches TARGET_VARIANT	PS3	moderate		Assays include WT comparator, GAPDH/β-actin controls, triplicate replicates, and quantitative statistics	Multiple independent functional assays show loss of secretion, increased ER stress and autophagy activation with appropriate WT comparator, consistent with damaging mechanism

In COS-7 cells, co-expression of RSUME with VHLL188V stabilizes HIF-2α and increases HIF-driven luciferase activity relative to VHLL188V alone. In RCC 786-O clones, VHLL188V promotes elevated VEGF expression and conditioned-medium-driven endothelial tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis, all of which are reduced upon RSUME knockdown.

PS3_supporting evidence is assigned based on these cell-based assays.	32766856	o4-mini					matched	medium	protein	V30I	p.V30I;;c.88G>A;;rs1603263395	Figure 2A;;Figure 2B;;Figure 2C;;Results paragraph describing V30I	Exact protein change V30I studied throughout;;HGVS c.88G>A corresponds but paper uses protein notation	PS3	supporting		Metridia luciferase normalization, β-actin loading control, anti–protein C and anti-Gla antibodies, 3 biological replicates	Cell-based assays in HEK293T cells show V30I reduces secretion and expression and alters g-carboxylation compared to WT, consistent with deleterious effect

In an ADAMTS13 cleavage assay using recombinant A2 fragments expressed in HEK293 cells, I1628T exhibited markedly increased cleavage compared to wild-type, completely cleaving within 5 hours and with a higher initial cleavage rate (~6% per minute vs <1% for WT; n=3). This functionally abnormal result consistent with increased proteolysis supports a PS3 supporting-level evidence call.	23110044	o4-mini					matched	medium	protein	I1628T	HGVSp p.I1628T	Abstract;;Introduction;;Results: Analysis of the native state;;Results: Cleavage experiments;;Figure 1;;Figure 6b;;Figure 8		PS3	supporting		WT comparator; three independent replicates; SD error bars	I1628T showed increased ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage relative to wild-type, consistent with type 2A VWD mechanism; variant match high confidence

Functional experiments in cybrid cells and in vitro show that the mutation introduces an m1G37 modification, reduces 5′ end processing and aminoacylation, destabilizes tRNAIle, and leads to decreased tRNA steady‐state levels. Downstream assays demonstrate impaired mitochondrial translation, OXPHOS complex assembly and activity, reduced respiration, Δψm and ATP production, and increased ROS and autophagy. Together, these well‐controlled assays support a PS3_moderate classification for this pathogenic variant.	33398350	o4-mini					matched	high	genomic	m.4295A>G;;4295A>G	chrM_4295_A>G;;m.4295A>G	Abstract;;Results section;;Figure 2B;;Figure 2C;;Figure 3B;;Figure 3C;;Figure 4A;;Figure 4B;;Figure 4C;;Figure 4D;;Figure 5A;;Figure 5B;;Figure 5C;;Figure 6A;;Figure 6B;;Figure 6C;;Figure 6D;;Figure 7A;;Figure 7B;;Figure 8A;;Figure 8B;;Figure 8C;;Figure 9A;;Figure 9B;;Figure 10A;;Figure 10B;;Figure 10C;;Figure 10D;;Figure 10E;;Figure 10F;;Figure 11A;;Figure 11B;;Figure 11C;;Figure 11D		PS3	moderate		well-established assays with clear WT comparators and multiple replication	Multiple independent functional assays in cybrid cells and in vitro demonstrate that m.4295A>G causes abnormal tRNAIle modification, processing, structure, aminoacylation, downstream mitochondrial translation and bioenergetics consistent with disease mechanism

These results support a functionally abnormal null-protein phenotype, satisfying PS3 (supporting).	20809529	o4-mini					matched	medium	multiple	c.38T>C;;p.Leu13Pro	c.38T>C;;p.Leu13Pro	Abstract;;Results: Mutations in hydrophobic segment of RS1 signal sequence;;Fig 5A;;Fig 5B	Variant is one of the four signal-sequence mutants analyzed (c.1A>T, c.35T>A, c.38T>C, c.52G>A);;Exact protein change p.Leu13Pro is used throughout the expression assays	PS3	supporting		WT and positive control mutants included; basic immunoblot controls	Compared to WT, p.Leu13Pro shows absent secretion and requires proteasome inhibition to detect precursor, consistent with loss of RS1 function
