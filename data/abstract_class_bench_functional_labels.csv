9634518,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of PAH deficiency correlate with PAH genotypes. We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories. We proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome. The observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79% of the cases, and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected. Among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4%-23% (P<.0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies. Our data indicate that the PAH-mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with PAH deficiency. In the present study, the classification of 105 PAH mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in >10,000 genotypes, which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
3615198,"Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene. The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. To determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5' splice donor site of intron 12. Thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during RNA splicing.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
15319459,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is characterized by reduction of blood phenylalanine level after a BH4-loading test. Most cases of BH4-responsive PAH deficiency include mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), but not all patients with mild PKU respond to BH4. We performed the phenylalanine breath test as reliable method to determine the BH4 responsiveness. Phenylalanine breath test quantitatively measures the conversion of L-[1-13C] phenylalanine to 13CO2 and is a noninvasive and rapid test. Twenty Japanese patients with HPA were examined with a dose of 10 mg/kg of 13C-phenylalanine with or without a dose of 10 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) of BH4 for 3 d. The phenylalanine breath test [cumulative recovery rate (CRR)] could distinguish control subjects (15.4 +/- 1.5%); heterozygotes (10.3 +/- 1.0%); and mild HPA (2.74%), mild PKU (1.13 +/- 0.14%), and classical PKU patients (0.29 +/- 0.14%). The genotypes in mild PKU cases were compound heterozygotes with mild (L52S, R241C, R408Q) and severe mutations, whereas a mild HPA case was homozygote of R241C. CRR correlated inversely with pretreatment phenylalanine levels, indicating the gene dosage effects on PKU. BH4 loading increased CRR from 1.13 +/- 0.14 to 2.95 +/- 1.14% (2.6-fold) in mild PKU and from 2.74 to 7.22% (2.6-fold) in mild HPA. A CRR of 5 to 6% reflected maintenance of appropriate serum phenylalanine level. The phenylalanine breath test is useful for the diagnosis of BH4-responsive PAH deficiency and determination of the optimal dosage of BH4 without increasing blood phenylalanine level.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
24401910,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is responsible for most cases of phenylketonuria (PKU). In this study of the PAH mutation spectrum in the Taiwanese population, 139 alleles were identified including 34 different mutations. The V190G, Q267R and F392I mutations are first reported in this study. The most common mutations, R241C, R408Q and Ex6-96A>G, account for 23.2%, 12.0% and 9.2%, of the mutant alleles, respectively. Haplotype analysis shows that R241C and Ex6-96A>G are exclusively associated with haplotype 4.3 to suggest founder effects. On the other hand, R408Q is found on two distinct haplotypes suggesting recurrent mutations. The spectrum of PAH mutations in Taiwan shows various links to those of other Asian regions, yet remarkable differences exist. Notably, R408Q, E286K and -4173_-407del, accounting for 21% of all mutant alleles in Taiwan, are very rare or are undetected among PKU cohorts of other Asian regions to suggest local founder effects. Moreover, the low homozygosity value of 0.092 hints at a high degree of ethnic heterogeneity within the Taiwanese population. Our study of PAH mutation spectrum and the associated haplotypes is useful for subsequent study on the origin and migration pattern via Taiwan, an island at the historical crossroad of migration of ancient populations.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
29706350,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in diverse cancers. Germline PTEN mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To empower new insights into PTEN function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of PTEN mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in vivo. Using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid PTEN variants (86% of possible). We identified 2,273 mutations with reduced cellular lipid phosphatase activity, which includes 1,789 missense mutations. These data recapitulated known functional findings but also uncovered new insights into PTEN protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. Several residues in the catalytic pocket showed surprising mutational tolerance. We identified that the solvent exposure of wild-type residues is a critical determinant of mutational tolerance. Further, we created a comprehensive functional map by leveraging correlations between amino acid substitutions to impute functional scores for all variants, including those not present in the assay. Variant functional scores can reliably discriminate likely pathogenic from benign alleles. Further, 32% of ClinVar unclassified missense variants are phosphatase deficient in our assay, supporting their reclassification. ASD-associated mutations generally had less severe fitness scores relative to PHTS-associated mutations (p = 7.16 × 10-5) and a higher fraction of hypomorphic mutations, arguing for continued genotype-phenotype studies in larger clinical datasets that can further leverage these rich functional data.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
30993208,"Anti-PTEN monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are arising as important tools for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and protein quantification routine analysis in clinical oncology. Although an effort has been made to document the reliability of tumor tissue section immunostaining by anti-PTEN mAb, and to standardize their IHC use in research and in the clinical practice, the precise topological and biochemical definition of the epitope recognized by each mAb has been conventionally overlooked. In this study, six commercial anti-PTEN mAb have been validated and characterized for sensitivity and specificity by IHC and FISH, using a set of prostate and urothelial bladder tumor specimens, and by immunoblot, using PTEN positive and PTEN negative human cell lines. Immunoblot precise epitope mapping, performed using recombinant PTEN variants and mutations, revealed that all mAb recognized linear epitopes of 6-11 amino acid length at the PTEN C-terminus. Tumor-associated or disease-associated mutations at the PTEN C-terminus did not affect subcellular localization or PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in cells, although resulted in specific loss of reactivity for some mAb. Furthermore, specific mimicking-phosphorylation mutations at the PTEN C-terminal region also abolished binding of specific mAb. Our study adds new evidence on the relevance of a precise epitope mapping in the validation of anti-PTEN mAb for their use in the clinics. This will be substantial to provide a more accurate diagnosis in clinical oncology based on PTEN protein expression in tumors and biological fluids.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
29785012,"Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
28677221,"Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN predispose to subsets of Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and autism. Evidence-based classification of PTEN variants as either deleterious or benign is urgently needed for accurate molecular diagnosis and gene-informed genetic counseling. We studied 34 different germline PTEN intronic variants from 61 CS patients, characterized their PTEN mRNA processing, and analyzed PTEN expression and downstream readouts of P-AKT and P-ERK1/2. While we found that many mutations near splice junctions result in exon skipping, we also identified the presence of cryptic splicing that resulted in premature termination or a shift in isoform usage. PTEN protein expression is significantly lower in the group with splicing changes while P-AKT, but not P-ERK1/2, is significantly increased. Our observations of these PTEN intronic variants should contribute to the determination of pathogenicity of PTEN intronic variants and aid in genetic counseling.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
32350270,"Functional variomics provides the foundation for personalized medicine by linking genetic variation to disease expression, outcome and treatment, yet its utility is dependent on appropriate assays to evaluate mutation impact on protein function. To fully assess the effects of 106 missense and nonsense variants of PTEN associated with autism spectrum disorder, somatic cancer and PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PHTS), we take a deep phenotypic profiling approach using 18 assays in 5 model systems spanning diverse cellular environments ranging from molecular function to neuronal morphogenesis and behavior. Variants inducing instability occur across the protein, resulting in partial-to-complete loss-of-function (LoF), which is well correlated across models. However, assays are selectively sensitive to variants located in substrate binding and catalytic domains, which exhibit complete LoF or dominant negativity independent of effects on stability. Our results indicate that full characterization of variant impact requires assays sensitive to instability and a range of protein functions.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
9256433,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have long been thought to play a role in tumor suppression due to their ability to antagonize the growth promoting protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor from 10q23, termed P-TEN, was isolated, and sequence homology was demonstrated with members of the PTP family, as well as the cytoskeletal protein tensin. Here we show that recombinant P-TEN dephosphorylated protein and peptide substrates phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, indicating that P-TEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase. In addition, P-TEN exhibited a high degree of substrate specificity, showing selectivity for extremely acidic substrates in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutations in P-TEN, identified from primary tumors, tumor cells lines, and a patient with Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, resulted in the ablation of phosphatase activity, demonstrating that enzymatic activity of P-TEN is necessary for its ability to function as a tumor suppressor.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
25230692,"Mutations in COCH (coagulation factor C homology) cause autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss with variable degrees of clinical onset and vestibular malfunction. We selected eight uncharacterized mutations and performed immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses to track cochlin through the secretory pathway. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of clinical information from DFNA9 patients with all 21 known COCH mutations in conjunction with cellular and molecular findings to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. Our studies revealed that five mutants were not secreted into the media: two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain mutants, which were not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates in cell lysates, and three LCCL domain mutants, which were detected as intracellular dimeric cochlins. Mutant cochlins that were not secreted and accumulated in cells result in earlier age of onset of hearing defects. In addition, individuals with LCCL domain mutations show accompanying vestibular dysfunction, whereas those with vWFA domain mutations exhibit predominantly hearing loss. This is the first report showing failure of mutant cochlin transport through the secretory pathway, abolishment of cochlin secretion, and formation and retention of dimers and large multimeric intracellular aggregates, and high correlation with earlier onset and progression of hearing loss in individuals with these DFNA9-causing mutations.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
24829265,"RATIONALE: Approximately 40% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in β-cardiac myosin heavy chain (β-MHC). Associating disease phenotype with mutation is confounded by extensive background genetic and lifestyle/environmental differences between subjects even from the same family.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize disease caused by β-cardiac myosin heavy chain Val606Met substitution (VM) that has been identified in several HCM families with wide variation of clinical outcomes, in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Unlike 2 mouse lines bearing the malignant myosin mutations Arg453Cys (RC/+) or Arg719Trp (RW/+), VM/+ mice with an identical inbred genetic background lacked hallmarks of HCM such as left ventricular hypertrophy, disarray of myofibers, and interstitial fibrosis. Even homozygous VM/VM mice were indistinguishable from wild-type animals, whereas RC/RC- and RW/RW-mutant mice died within 9 days after birth. However, hypertrophic effects of the VM mutation were observed both in mice treated with cyclosporine, a known stimulator of the HCM response, and compound VM/RC heterozygous mice, which developed a severe HCM phenotype. In contrast to all heterozygous mutants, both systolic and diastolic function of VM/RC hearts was severely impaired already before the onset of cardiac remodeling.
CONCLUSIONS: The VM mutation per se causes mild HCM-related phenotypes; however, in combination with other HCM activators it exacerbates the HCM phenotype. Double-mutant mice are suitable for assessing the severity of benign mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
16983074,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leads to heart failure, a leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Approximately 30% of DCM cases are genetic in origin, with some resulting from point mutations in cardiac myosin, the molecular motor of the heart. The effects of these mutations on myosin's molecular mechanics have not been determined. We have engineered two murine models characterizing the physiological, cellular, and molecular effects of DCM-causing missense mutations (S532P and F764L) in the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain and compared them with WT mice. Mutant mice developed morphological and functional characteristics of DCM consistent with the human phenotypes. Contractile function of isolated myocytes was depressed and preceded left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening. In an in vitro motility assay, both mutant cardiac myosins exhibited a reduced ability to translocate actin (V(actin)) but had similar force-generating capacities. Actin-activated ATPase activities were also reduced. Single-molecule laser trap experiments revealed that the lower V(actin) in the S532P mutant was due to a reduced ability of the motor to generate a step displacement and an alteration of the kinetics of its chemomechanical cycle. These results suggest that the depressed molecular function in cardiac myosin may initiate the events that cause the heart to remodel and become pathologically dilated.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
23313350,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease characterized by dilation of the ventricular chambers and reduced contractile function. We examined the contractile performance of chemically-skinned ventricular strips from two heterozygous murine models of DCM-causing missense mutations of myosin, F764L/+ and S532P/+, in an α-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) background. In Ca(2+)-activated skinned myocardial strips, the maximum developed tension in F764L/+ was only ~50% that of litter-mate controls (+/+). The F764L/+ also exhibited significantly reduced rigor stiffness, loaded shortening velocity and power output. Corresponding indices for S532P/+ strips were not different from controls. Manipulation of MgATP concentration in conjunction with measures of viscoelasticity, which provides estimates of myosin detachment rate 2πc, allowed us to probe the molecular basis of changes in crossbridge kinetics that occur with the myosin mutations. By examining the response of detachment rate to varying MgATP we found the rate of MgADP release was unaffected by the myosin mutations. However, MgATP binding rate was higher in the DCM groups compared to controls (422±109mM(-1)·s(-1) in F764L/+, 483±74mM(-1)·s(-1) in S532P/+ and 303±18mM(-1)·s(-1) in +/+). In addition, the rate constant of force development, 2πb, was significantly higher in DCM groups compared to controls (at 5mM MgATP: 36.9±4.9s(-1) in F764L/+, 32.9±4.5s(-1) in S532P/+ and 18.2±1.7s(-1) in +/+). These results suggest that elevated rates of force development and MgATP binding are features of cardiac myofilament function that underlie the development of DCM.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
17143282,"Noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects and skeletal anomalies. Increased RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling due to PTPN11 and KRAS mutations causes 50% of cases of Noonan syndrome. Here, we report that 22 of 129 individuals with Noonan syndrome without PTPN11 or KRAS mutation have missense mutations in SOS1, which encodes a RAS-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. SOS1 mutations cluster at codons encoding residues implicated in the maintenance of SOS1 in its autoinhibited form. In addition, ectopic expression of two Noonan syndrome-associated mutants induces enhanced RAS and ERK activation. The phenotype associated with SOS1 defects lies within the Noonan syndrome spectrum but is distinctive, with a high prevalence of ectodermal abnormalities but generally normal development and linear growth. Our findings implicate gain-of-function mutations in a RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor in disease for the first time and define a new mechanism by which upregulation of the RAS pathway can profoundly change human development.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
23487764,"Defects in the RAS small G protein or its associated network of regulatory proteins that disrupt GTPase cycling are a major cause of cancer and developmental RASopathy disorders. Lack of robust functional assays has been a major hurdle in RAS pathway-targeted drug development. We used NMR to obtain detailed mechanistic data on RAS cycling defects conferred by oncogenic mutations, or full-length RASopathy-derived regulatory proteins. By monitoring the conformation of wild-type and oncogenic RAS in real-time, we show that opposing properties integrate with regulators to hyperactivate oncogenic RAS mutants. Q61L and G13D exhibited rapid nucleotide exchange and an unexpected susceptibility to GAP-mediated hydrolysis, in direct contrast with G12V, indicating different approaches must be taken to inhibit these oncoproteins. An NMR methodology was established to directly monitor RAS cycling by intact, multidomain proteins encoded by RASopathy genes in mammalian cell extracts. By measuring GAP activity from tumor cells, we demonstrate how loss of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) increases RAS-GTP levels in NF1-derived cells. We further applied this methodology to profile Noonan Syndrome (NS)-derived SOS1 mutants. Combining NMR with cell-based assays allowed us to differentiate defects in catalysis, allosteric regulation, and membrane targeting of individual mutants, while revealing a membrane-dependent compensatory effect that attenuates dramatic increases in RAS activation shown by Y337C, L550P, and I252T. Our NMR method presents a precise and robust measure of RAS activity, providing mechanistic insights that facilitate discovery of therapeutics targeted against the RAS signaling network.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
19684605,"N-myristoylation is a common form of co-translational protein fatty acylation resulting from the attachment of myristate to a required N-terminal glycine residue. We show that aberrantly acquired N-myristoylation of SHOC2, a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that positively modulates RAS-MAPK signal flow, underlies a clinically distinctive condition of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders family. Twenty-five subjects with a relatively consistent phenotype previously termed Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (MIM607721) shared the 4A>G missense change in SHOC2 (producing an S2G amino acid substitution) that introduces an N-myristoylation site, resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. Expression of SHOC2(S2G) in vitro enhanced MAPK activation in a cell type-specific fashion. Induction of SHOC2(S2G) in Caenorhabditis elegans engendered protruding vulva, a neomorphic phenotype previously associated with aberrant signaling.

15987685,"Mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) underlie half of the cases of the autosomal dominant genetic disorder Noonan syndrome, and somatic Shp2 mutations are found in several hematologic and solid malignancies. Earlier studies of small numbers of mutants suggested that disease-associated mutations cause constitutive (SH2 binding-independent) activation and that cancer-associated mutants are more active than those associated with Noonan syndrome. We have characterized a larger panel of Shp2 mutants and find that this ""activity-centric"" model cannot explain the behaviors of all pathogenic Shp2 mutations. Instead, enzymatic, structural, and mathematical modeling analyses show that these mutants can affect basal activation, SH2 domain-phosphopeptide affinity, and/or substrate specificity to varying degrees. Furthermore, there is no absolute correlation between the mutants' extents of basal activation and the diseases they induce. We propose that activated mutants of Shp2 modulate signaling from specific stimuli to a subset of effectors and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the complex relationship between Shp2 activation, intracellular signaling, and pathology.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
20949621,"The KRAS gene is the most common locus for somatic gain-of-function mutations in human cancer. Germline KRAS mutations were shown recently to be associated with developmental disorders, including Noonan syndrome (NS), cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and Costello syndrome (CS). The molecular basis of this broad phenotypic variability has in part remained elusive so far. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the biochemical and structural features of ten germline KRAS mutations using physical and cellular biochemistry. According to their distinct biochemical and structural alterations, the mutants can be grouped into five distinct classes, four of which markedly differ from RAS oncoproteins. Investigated functional alterations comprise the enhancement of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzed nucleotide exchange, which is alternatively accompanied by an impaired GTPase-activating protein (GAP) stimulated GTP hydrolysis, an overall loss of functional properties, and a deficiency in effector interaction. In conclusion, our data underscore the important role of RAS in the pathogenesis of the group of related disorders including NS, CFCS, and CS, and provide clues to the high phenotypic variability of patients with germline KRAS mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Mutant K-Ras proteins demonstrate a range of gain-of-function effects in different cell types, and biochemical analysis supports the idea that the intrinsic Ras guanosine nucleotide triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, the responsiveness of these proteins to GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation all regulate developmental programs in vivo.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Two disease-associated mutations, G12V and G12S, have previously been observed in patients with Costello syndrome (CS), and two other mutations, E63K and Q22K, are novel. All four mutations are predicted to enhance downstream HRas signalling, suggesting that CMEMS is a developmental consequence of sustained HRas activation in skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSION: This type of myopathy may represent a previously unrecognized manifestation of CS. However, some patients carrying HRAS mutations may exhibit prominent congenital muscular dysfunction, although features of CS may be less obvious, suggesting that germline HRAS mutations may underlie some cases of otherwise unclassified neonatal neuromuscular disorders.",PS3_strong,1,1,,0,
21850009,"Costello syndrome (CS) is a congenital disease that is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, failure to thrive, mental retardation and cardiomyopathy. In 2005, we discovered that heterozygous germline mutations in HRAS caused CS. Several studies have shown that CS-associated HRAS mutations are clustered in codons 12 and 13, and mutations in other codons have also been identified. However, a comprehensive comparison of the substitutions identified in patients with CS has not been conducted. In the current study, we identified four mutations (p.G12S, p.G12A, p.G12C and p.G12D) in 21 patients and analyzed the associated clinical manifestations of CS in these individuals. To examine functional differences among the identified mutations, we characterized a total of nine HRAS mutants, including seven distinct substitutions in codons 12 and 13, p.K117R and p.A146T. The p.A146T mutant demonstrated the weakest Raf-binding activity, and the p.K117R and p.A146T mutants had weaker effects on downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling than did codon 12 or 13 mutants. We demonstrated that these mutant HRAS proteins induced senescence when overexpressed in human fibroblasts. Oncogene-induced senescence is a cellular reaction that controls cell proliferation in response to oncogenic mutation and it has been considered one of the tumor suppression mechanisms in vivo. Our findings suggest that the HRAS mutations identified in CS are sufficient to cause oncogene-induced senescence and that cellular senescence might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of CS.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause approximately 50% of Noonan syndrome cases. SHP2 is required for RAS-ERK MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade activation, and Noonan syndrome mutants enhance ERK activation ex vivo and in mice. KRAS mutations account for <5% of cases of Noonan syndrome, but the gene(s) responsible for the remainder are unknown. We identified missense mutations in SOS1, which encodes an essential RAS guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (RAS-GEF), in approximately 20% of cases of Noonan syndrome without PTPN11 mutation. The prevalence of specific cardiac defects differs in SOS1 mutation-associated Noonan syndrome.

We show that these mutations impair binding of 14-3-3 proteins to C-RAF and alter its subcellular localization by promoting Ras-mediated plasma membrane recruitment of C-RAF. By presenting biophysical binding data, the 14-3-3/C-RAFpS(259) crystal structure, and cellular analyses, we indicate a mechanistic link between a well-described human developmental disorder and the impairment of a 14-3-3/target protein interaction. As a broader implication of these findings, modulating the C-RAFSer(259)/14-3-3 protein-protein interaction with a stabilizing small molecule may yield a novel potential approach for treatment of diseases resulting from an overactive Ras-RAF-MAPK pathway.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
19509418,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by multiple birth defects including heart defects and myeloproliferative disease (MPD). Approximately 50% of NS patients have germline gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2. We provide evidence that conditional ablation of Stat3 in hematopoietic cells and cardiac valvular tissues leads to myeloid progenitor hyperplasia and pulmonary stenosis due to the leaflet thickening, respectively. Consistently, STAT3 activation is significantly compromised in peripheral blood cells from NS patients bearing Shp2-activating mutations. Biochemical and functional analyses demonstrate that activated Shp2 is able to down-regulate Tyr(P)-Stat3 and that constitutively active Stat3 rescues activating mutant Shp2-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in bone marrow cells. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Stat3 is an essential signaling component potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia caused by PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
20308328,"LEOPARD syndrome (LS), a disorder with multiple developmental abnormalities, is mainly due to mutations that impair the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11). How these alterations cause the disease remains unknown. We report here that fibroblasts isolated from LS patients displayed stronger epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of both AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) than fibroblasts from control patients. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of SHP2. We found that the GAB1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both AKT and GSK-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing GAB1 expression or by overexpressing a GAB1 mutant unable to bind to PI3K. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate GAB1 PI3K-binding sites. These mutants induced PI3K-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, SHP2 mutations causing LS facilitate EGF-induced PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta stimulation through impaired GAB1 dephosphorylation, resulting in deregulation of a novel signaling pathway that could be involved in LS pathology.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
30867592,"Histiocytic neoplasms are a heterogeneous group of clonal haematopoietic disorders that are marked by diverse mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway1,2. For the 50% of patients with histiocytosis who have BRAFV600 mutations3-5, RAF inhibition is highly efficacious and has markedly altered the natural history of the disease6,7. However, no standard therapy exists for the remaining 50% of patients who lack BRAFV600 mutations. Although ERK dependence has been hypothesized to be a consistent feature across histiocytic neoplasms, this remains clinically unproven and many of the kinase mutations that are found in patients who lack BRAFV600 mutations have not previously been biologically characterized. Here we show ERK dependency in histiocytoses through a proof-of-concept clinical trial of cobimetinib, an oral inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, in patients with histiocytoses. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour genotype. In parallel, MAPK alterations that were identified in treated patients were characterized for their ability to activate ERK. In the 18 patients that we treated, the overall response rate was 89% (90% confidence interval of 73-100). Responses were durable, with no acquired resistance to date. At one year, 100% of responses were ongoing and 94% of patients remained progression-free. Cobimetinib treatment was efficacious regardless of genotype, and responses were observed in patients with ARAF, BRAF, RAF1, NRAS, KRAS, MEK1 (also known as MAP2K1) and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K2) mutations. Consistent with the observed responses, the characterization of the mutations that we identified in these patients confirmed that the MAPK-pathway mutations were activating. Collectively, these data demonstrate that histiocytic neoplasms are characterized by a notable dependence on MAPK signalling-and that they are consequently responsive to MEK inhibition. These results extend the benefits of molecularly targeted therapy to the entire spectrum of patients with histiocytosis.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

CFC is a rare multiple congenital anomaly disorder in which individuals have characteristic dysmorphic features, cardiac defects, ectodermal anomalies and developmental delay.We report a 7(1/2)-month-old boy with a clinical diagnosis of CFC. Bidirectional sequence analysis of MEK2 revealed a novel c.383C-->A transversion in exon 3 resulting in a nonsynonymous missense substitution, p.P128Q. Other family members, including the proband's mother and half-sibling, displayed phenotypic features of CFC and were also screened for the MEK2 mutation identified in the proband. Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) analysis determined the novel MEK2 p.P128Q to be deleterious. To corroborate the functional alteration of the novel mutant protein, transient transfection of HEK 293T cells with subsequent Western analysis was used to demonstrate increased kinase activity, as measured by ERK phosphorylation.

Known causative genes account for 70-80% of clinically diagnosed NS patients, but the genetic basis for the remaining 20-30% of cases is unknown. We performed next-generation sequencing on germ-line DNA from 27 NS patients lacking a mutation in the known NS genes. We identified gain-of-function alleles in Ras-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1) and previously unseen loss-of-function variants in RAS p21 protein activator 2 (RASA2) that are likely to cause NS in these patients. Expression of the mutant RASA2, MAP2K1, or RIT1 alleles in heterologous cells increased RAS-ERK pathway activation, supporting a causative role in NS pathogenesis. Two patients had more than one disease-associated variant. Moreover, the diagnosis of an individual initially thought to have NS was revised to neurofibromatosis type 1 based on an NF1 nonsense mutation detected in this patient. Another patient harbored a missense mutation in NF1 that resulted in decreased protein stability and impaired ability to suppress RAS-ERK activation; however, this patient continues to exhibit a NS-like phenotype. In addition, a nonsense mutation in RPS6KA3 was found in one patient initially diagnosed with NS whose diagnosis was later revised to Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Finally, we identified other potential candidates for new NS genes, as well as potential carrier alleles for unrelated syndromes. Taken together, our data suggest that next-generation sequencing can provide a useful adjunct to RASopathy diagnosis and emphasize that the standard clinical categories for RASopathies might not be adequate to describe all patients.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior. Furthermore, we show that the systemic impact of missense mutations can be effectively quantified as a combination of protein stability change and pathway perturbation.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,

Children born with germ-line mutations in BRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 develop cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, skin and hair abnormalities and mental retardation. CFC syndrome mutations in BRAF promote both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired variants. CFC syndrome has a progressive phenotype, and the availability of clinically active inhibitors of the MAPK pathway prompts the important question as to whether such inhibitors might be therapeutically effective in the treatment of CFC syndrome. To study the developmental effects of CFC mutant alleles in vivo, we have expressed a panel of 28 BRAF and MEK alleles in zebrafish embryos to assess the function of human disease alleles and available chemical inhibitors of this pathway. We find that both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired CFC mutant alleles promote the equivalent developmental outcome when expressed during early development and that treatment of CFC-zebrafish embryos with inhibitors of the FGF-MAPK pathway can restore normal early development. Importantly, we find a developmental window in which treatment with a MEK inhibitor can restore the normal early development of the embryo, without the additional, unwanted developmental effects of the drug.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

In each family, the CDH1 mutation was a splicing mutation generating aberrant transcripts with an in-frame deletion, removing the extracellular cadherin repeat domains involved in cell-cell adhesion. Such transcripts might encode mutant proteins with trans-dominant negative effects. We found that CDH1 is highly expressed at 4 and 5 weeks in the frontonasal prominence, and at 6 weeks in the lateral and medial nasal prominences of human embryos, and is therefore expressed during the critical stages of lip and palate development.

For patients who meet the HDGC screening criteria, the identification and classification of the sequence variants found in CDH1 are critical for risk management of patients. In this report, we describe a germline CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant identified in a 50 year old man who was diagnosed with gastric cancer with a strong family history of gastric cancer (one living brother was diagnosed with gastric cancer at 63 and another brother died of gastric cancer at 45). cDNA analysis, involving fragment analysis and cloning, indicated that the p.T560R mutation created a novel 5' splice donor site, which led to a novel transcript with a 32 nucleotide deletion in exon 11. This abnormal transcript putatively produces a truncated CDH1 protein (E-cadherin) of 575 amino acids instead of 882. We also demonstrated that the variant completely abolishes normal splicing as the mutant allele does not generate any normal transcript. Furthermore, the CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant segregated with gastric cancer in all three family members affected with gastric cancer in this family. These results support the conclusion that CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant is a pathogenic mutation and contributes to HDGC through disruption of normal splicing.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

However, even with a sufficient amount of E-cadherin, cell-cell adhesion is sometimes lost in ""diffusely invasive"" human carcinomas. Ten human cancer cell lines, showing growth characterized morphologically by loose cell-cell adhesion, were analyzed for possible structural abnormalities of their expressed E-cadherin. Four of the cell lines showed strong mRNA and protein expression with no nucleotide sequence abnormalities, and mRNA was absent in four other cell lines. mRNA sequence was abnormal in the remaining two gastric carcinoma cell lines. In MKN45 (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma), this involved a 12-bp in-frame deletion with strong expression of mRNA and protein. In KATO-III (signet ring cell carcinoma), there were four mRNA species with insertions of different sizes, among which the major transcripts (with a 7-bp insertion) caused a frameshift, and expression of both mRNA and protein was markedly reduced. In these two cell lines, DNA mutations were detected around exon-intron junctions, revealing that aberrant RNA splicing was the cause of the mRNA abnormalities. In addition, the wild-type allele of the E-cadherin locus was lost, suggesting that the E-cadherin gene had been inactivated by two hits (mutation and allele loss), similar to the mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
9537325,"The identification of genes predisposing to familial cancer is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families. Despite a declining incidence, gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer death worldwide, and about 10% of cases show familial clustering. The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric cancer are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric cancer. Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset, histologically poorly differentiated, high grade, diffuse gastric cancer in a large kindred from New Zealand (Aotearoa). Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin. Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7, leading to a truncated gene product. Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinomas. Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types, and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells. The role of E-cadherin in gastric cancer susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric cancer families. In one family, a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15, and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13. These results describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a molecular basis for familial gastric cancer, and confirm the important role of E-cadherin mutations in cancer.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
15235021,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations.
METHODS: Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing.
RESULTS: Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families.
CONCLUSION: Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age.

26579216,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in social communication/interaction and inflexible/repetitive behavior. Several lines of evidence support genetic factors as a predominant cause of ASD. Among those autism susceptibility genes that have been identified, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, initially identified as predisposing to Cowden heritable cancer syndrome, was found to be mutated in a subset of ASD patients with extreme macrocephaly. However, the ASD-relevant molecular mechanism mediating the effect of PTEN mutations remains elusive.
METHODS: We developed a Pten knock-in murine model to study the effects of Pten germline mutations, specifically altering subcellular localization, in ASD. Proteins were isolated from the hemispheres of the male littermates, and Western blots were performed to determine protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Immunohistochemical stains were carried out to validate the localization of TH and dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). PC12 cells ectopically expressing either wild-type or missense mutant PTEN were then compared for the differences in TH expression.
RESULTS: Mice carrying Pten mutations have high TH and D2R in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. They also have increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and TH. Mechanistically, PTEN downregulates TH production in PC12 cells via inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/CREB signaling pathway, while PTEN reduces TH phosphorylation via suppressing MAPK pathway. Unlike wild-type PTEN but similar to the mouse knock-in mutant Pten, three naturally occurring missense mutations of PTEN that we previously identified in ASD patients, H93R, F241S, and D252G, were not able to suppress TH when overexpressed in PC12 cells. In addition, two other PTEN missense mutations, C124S (pan phosphatase dead) and G129E (lipid phosphatase dead), failed to suppress TH when ectopically expressed in PC12 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a non-canonical PTEN-TH pathway in the brain that may work as a core regulator of dopamine signaling, which when dysfunctional is pathogenic in ASD.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

The enzyme PTEN, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the phosphoinositide PIP3, is damaged in most sporadic tumors. Mutations in the PTEN gene have also been linked to autism spectrum disorders and other forms of delayed development. Here, human PTEN is shown to be on the cusp of unfolding under physiological conditions. Variants of human PTEN linked to somatic cancers and disorders on the autism spectrum are shown to be impaired in their conformational stability, catalytic activity, or both. Those variants linked only to autism have activity higher than the activity of those linked to cancers. PTEN-L, which is a secreted trans-active isoform, has conformational stability greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. These data indicate that PTEN is a fragile enzyme cast in a crucial role in cellular metabolism and suggest that PTEN-L is a repository for a critical catalytic activity.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
20718038,"The tumor suppressor, phosphatase, and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), is a phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase specific for the 3-position of the inositol ring. PTEN has been implicated in autism for a subset of patients with macrocephaly. Various studies identified patients in this subclass with one normal and one mutated PTEN gene. We characterize the binding, structural properties, activity, and subcellular localization of one of these autism-related mutants, H93R PTEN. Even though this mutation is located at the phosphatase active site, we find that it affects the functions of neighboring domains. H93R PTEN binding to phosphatidylserine-bearing model membranes is 5.6-fold enhanced in comparison to wild-type PTEN. In contrast, we find that binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) model membranes is 2.5-fold decreased for the mutant PTEN in comparison to wild-type PTEN. The structural change previously found for wild-type PTEN upon interaction with PI(4,5)P(2), is absent for H93R PTEN. Consistent with the increased binding to phosphatidylserine, we find enhanced plasma membrane association of PTEN-GFP in U87MG cells. However, this enhanced plasma membrane association does not translate into increased PI(3,4,5)P(3) turnover, since in vivo studies show a reduced activity of the H93R PTEN-GFP mutant. Because the interaction of PI(4,5)P(2) with PTEN's N-terminal domain is diminished by this mutation, we hypothesize that the interaction of PTEN's N-terminal domain with the phosphatase domain is impacted by the H93R mutation, preventing PI(4,5)P(2) from inducing the conformational change that activates phosphatase activity.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

PTEN is mutated in a subset of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the mechanism by which specific point mutations alter PTEN function is largely unknown. Here, we assessed how ASD-associated single-nucleotide variations in PTEN (ASD-PTEN) affect function.
METHODS: We used viral-mediated molecular substitution of human PTEN into Pten knockout mouse neurons and assessed neuronal morphology to determine the functional impact of ASD-PTEN. We employed molecular cloning to examine how PTEN's stability, subcellular localization, and catalytic activity affect neuronal growth.
RESULTS: We identified a set of ASD-PTEN mutations displaying altered lipid phosphatase function and subcellular localization. We demonstrated that wild-type PTEN can rescue the neuronal hypertrophy, while PTEN H93R, F241S, D252G, W274L, N276S, and D326N failed to rescue this hypertrophy. A subset of these mutations lacked nuclear localization, prompting us to examine the role of nuclear PTEN in regulating neuronal growth. We found that nuclear PTEN alone is sufficient to regulate soma size. Furthermore, forced localization of the D252G and W274L mutations into the nucleus partially restores regulation of soma size.
CONCLUSIONS: ASD-PTEN mutations display decreased stability, catalytic activity, and/or altered subcellular localization. Mutations lacking nuclear localization uncover a novel mechanism whereby lipid phosphatase activity in the nucleus can regulate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and neuronal growth.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

In this study, in silico prediction and in vitro prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were used to functionally characterize five PAH missense variants (p.F233I, p.R270I, p.F331S, p.S350Y, and p.L358F) previously identified in Slovak and Czech patients. p.F233I, p.R270I, and p.S350Y were classified as deleterious mutations since they showed no specific activity in functional assay and no response to chaperone co-expression. Protein levels of these PAH variants were very low when expressed in HepG2 cells, and only p.S350Y responded to BH4 precursor overload by significant increase in PAH monomer, probably due to reduced rate of protein degradation as the result of proper protein folding. Variants p.F331S and p.L358F exerted residual enzymatic activity in vitro. While the first can be classified as probably pathogenic due to its very low protein levels in HepG2 cells, the latter is considered to be mild mutation with protein levels of approximately 17.85% compared to wt PAH.

However, the molecular basis of the dysfunction of USH gene, myosin VIIa, in the affected families is unknown to date. Here we clarified the effects of USH1B mutations on human myosin VIIa motor function for the first time. The missense mutations of USH1B significantly inhibited the actin activation of ATPase activity of myosin VIIa. G25R, R212C, A397D, and E450Q mutations abolished the actin-activated ATPase activity completely. P503L mutation increased the basal ATPase activity for 2-3-fold but reduced the actin-activated ATPase activity to 50% of the wild type. While all of the mutations examined, except for R302H, reduced the affinity for actin and the ATP hydrolysis cycling rate, they did not largely decrease the rate of ADP release from actomyosin, suggesting that the mutations reduce the duty ratio of myosin VIIa. Taken together, the results suggest that the mutations responsible for USH1B cause the complete loss of the actin-activated ATPase activity or the reduction of duty ratio of myosin VIIa.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

I35S and R184P showed impaired trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane. I33T, R75W, E120del and W172R showed predominantly membrane localization but did not form functional gap junction channels.

KCNQ3 is widely thought to co-assemble with several other KCNQ subtypes, whereas KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 do not. However, the existence of other subunit assemblies is not well studied. To systematically explore the heteromeric assembly of KCNQ channels in individual living cells, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged KCNQ subunits expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in which excitation light only penetrates several hundred nanometers into the cell, thus isolating membrane events. We found significant FRET between homomeric subunits as expected from their functional expression in heterologous expression systems. Also as expected from previous work, robust FRET was observed between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. KCNQ3 and KCNQ4 also showed substantial FRET as did KCNQ4 and KCNQ5. To determine functional assembly of KCNQ4/KCNQ5 heteromers, we performed two types of experiments. In the first, we constructed a mutant tetraethylammonium ion-sensitive KCNQ4 subunit and tested its assembly with KCNQ5 by patch clamp analysis of the tetraethylammonium ion sensitivity of the resulting current; however, those data were not conclusive. In the second, we co-expressed a KCNQ4 (G285S) pore mutant with KCNQ5 and found the former to act as a dominant negative, suggesting co-assembly of the two types of subunits.

Experimental data on a set of missense mutations of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) associated with the monogenic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) have been compared with the expected in vivo impact on protein function, obtained using SNPs3D, an in silico analysis package. A high proportion of the PAH mutations are predicted to be destabilizing. The overall agreement between predicted stability impact and experimental evidence for lower protein levels is in accordance with the estimated error rates of the methods. For these mutations, destabilization of protein three-dimensional structure is the major molecular mechanism leading to PKU, and results in a substantial reduction of in vivo PAH protein concentration. Although of limited scale, the results support the view that destabilization is the most common mechanism by which missense mutations cause monogenic disease. In turn, this conclusion suggests the general therapeutic strategy of developing drugs targeted at restoring wild type stability.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
28512244,"Oncogenic gene fusions drive many human cancers, but tools to more quickly unravel their functional contributions are needed. Here we describe methodology permitting fusion gene construction for functional evaluation. Using this strategy, we engineered the known fusion oncogenes, BCR-ABL1, EML4-ALK, and ETV6-NTRK3, as well as 20 previously uncharacterized fusion genes identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In addition to confirming oncogenic activity of the known fusion oncogenes engineered by our construction strategy, we validated five novel fusion genes involving MET, NTRK2, and BRAF kinases that exhibited potent transforming activity and conferred sensitivity to FDA-approved kinase inhibitors. Our fusion construction strategy also enabled domain-function studies of BRAF fusion genes. Our results confirmed other reports that the transforming activity of BRAF fusions results from truncation-mediated loss of inhibitory domains within the N-terminus of the BRAF protein. BRAF mutations residing within this inhibitory region may provide a means for BRAF activation in cancer, therefore we leveraged the modular design of our fusion gene construction methodology to screen N-terminal domain mutations discovered in tumors that are wild-type at the BRAF mutation hotspot, V600. We identified an oncogenic mutation, F247L, whose expression robustly activated the MAPK pathway and sensitized cells to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. When applied broadly, these tools will facilitate rapid fusion gene construction for subsequent functional characterization and translation into personalized treatment strategies.

15834506,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by short stature, characteristic facial features, and heart defects. Recently, missense mutations of PTPN11, the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-2, were identified in patients with NS. Further, somatic mutations in PTPN11 were detected in childhood leukemia. Recent studies showed that the phosphatase activities of five mutations identified in NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) were increased. However, the functional properties of the other mutations remain unidentified. In this study, in order to clarify the differences between the mutations identified in NS and leukemia, we examined the phosphatase activity of 14 mutants of SHP-2. We identified nine mutations, including a novel F71I mutation, in 16 of 41 NS patients and two mutations, including a novel G503V mutation, in three of 29 patients with leukemia. Immune complex phosphatase assays of individual mutants transfected in COS7 cells showed that ten mutants identified in NS and four mutants in leukemia showed 1.4-fold to 12.7-fold increased activation compared with wild-type SHP-2. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of NS and leukemia is associated with enhanced phosphatase activity of mutant SHP-2. A comparison of the phosphatase activity in each mutant and a review of previously reported cases showed that high phosphatase activity observed in mutations at codons 61, 71, 72, and 76 was significantly associated with leukemogenesis.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
18372317,"Missense PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (NS and LS), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. For a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. We analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS. Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of SHP2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. The recognition specificity of the C-SH2 domain bearing the E139D substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the N-SH2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of SHP2's functional dysregulation. Finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Transient expression of mutant full-length cDNAs in human HEK293 cells yielded PAH variants whose l-phenylalanine hydroxylase activity was between 40% and 70% that of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a 50-kD monomer in all mutants thereby indicating normal synthesis of the mutant proteins. Because of the clinical mild nature of the phenotypes we performed an in vivo BH4 loading test. This was positive in all tested patients, which indicates that they are likely to respond to the coenzyme in vivo. We also analysed the environment of each mutation site in the available crystal structures of PAH by using molecular graphics tools. The structural alteration produced by each mutation was elucidated and correlated to the mutated properties of the mutant enzymes.

24935154,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is a critical signal transducer downstream of growth factors that promotes the activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 cascade. In its basal state, SHP2 exists in an autoinhibited closed conformation because of an intramolecular interaction between its N-SH2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains. Binding to pTyr ligands present on growth factor receptors and adaptor proteins with its N-SH2 domain localizes SHP2 to its substrates and frees the active site from allosteric inhibition. Germline mutations in SHP2 are known to cause both Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS), two clinically similar autosomal dominant developmental disorders. NS-associated SHP2 mutants display elevated phosphatase activity, while LS-associated SHP2 mutants exhibit reduced catalytic activity. A conundrum in how clinically similar diseases result from mutations to SHP2 that have opposite effects on this enzyme's catalytic functionality exists. Here we report a comprehensive investigation of the kinetic, structural, dynamic, and biochemical signaling properties of the wild type as well as all reported LS-associated SHP2 mutants. The results reveal that LS-causing mutations not only affect SHP2 phosphatase activity but also induce a weakening of the intramolecular interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains, leading to mutants that are more readily activated by competing pTyr ligands. Our data also indicate that the residual phosphatase activity associated with the LS SHP2 mutant is required for enhanced ERK1/2 activation. Consequently, catalytically impaired SHP2 mutants could display gain-of-function properties because of their ability to localize to the vicinity of substrates for longer periods of time, thereby affording the opportunity for prolonged substrate turnover and sustained RAS-ERK1/2 activation.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
18849586,"Missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause clinically similar but distinctive disorders, LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes. The LS is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities including lentigines, cardiac defects, short stature and deafness. Biochemical analyses indicated that LS alleles engender loss-of-function (LOF) effects, while NS mutations result in gain-of-function (GOF). These biochemical findings lead to an enigma that how PTPN11 mutations with opposite effects on function result in disorders that are so similar. To study the developmental effects of the commonest LS PTPN11 alleles (Y279C and T468M), we generated LS transgenic fruitflies using corkscrew (csw), the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. Ubiquitous expression of the LS csw mutant alleles resulted in ectopic wing veins and, for the Y279C allele, rough eyes with increased R7 photoreceptor numbers. These were GOF phenotypes mediated by increased RAS/MAPK signaling and requiring the LS mutant's residual phosphatase activity. Our findings provide the first evidence that LS mutant alleles have GOF developmental effects despite reduced phosphatase activity, providing a rationale for how PTPN11 mutations with GOF and LOF produce similar but distinctive syndromes.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively modulates RAS function. Here, we characterized functionally all possible amino acid substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 62 and 63 to explore the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the Y62D and Y63C substitutions recurring in Noonan syndrome. We provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the N-SH2 domain. Most mutations affecting Tyr(63) exerted an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding cleft mediating the interaction of SHP2 with signaling partners. Among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease-causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of the inactive conformation of SHP2 without severely impairing proper phosphopeptide binding of N-SH2. On the other hand, the disruptive effect of the Y62D change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant. Overall, our data demonstrate that the selection-by-function mechanism acting as driving force for PTPN11 mutations affecting codons 62 and 63 implies balancing of counteracting effects operating on the allosteric control of the function of SHP2.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
23967136,"Human Connexin26 gene mutations cause hearing loss. These hereditary mutations are the leading cause of childhood deafness worldwide. Mutations in gap junction proteins (connexins) can impair intercellular communication by eliminating protein synthesis, mis-trafficking, or inducing channels that fail to dock or have aberrant function. We previously identified a new class of mutants that form non-functional gap junction channels and hemichannels (connexons) by disrupting packing and inter-helix interactions. Here we analyzed fourteen point mutations in the fourth transmembrane helix of connexin26 (Cx26) that cause non-syndromic hearing loss. Eight mutations caused mis-trafficking (K188R, F191L, V198M, S199F, G200R, I203K, L205P, T208P). Of the remaining six that formed gap junctions in mammalian cells, M195T and A197S formed stable hemichannels after isolation with a baculovirus/Sf9 protein purification system, while C202F, I203T, L205V and N206S formed hemichannels with varying degrees of instability. The function of all six gap junction-forming mutants was further assessed through measurement of dye coupling in mammalian cells and junctional conductance in paired Xenopus oocytes. Dye coupling between cell pairs was reduced by varying degrees for all six mutants. In homotypic oocyte pairings, only A197S induced measurable conductance. In heterotypic pairings with wild-type Cx26, five of the six mutants formed functional gap junction channels, albeit with reduced efficiency. None of the mutants displayed significant alterations in sensitivity to transjunctional voltage or induced conductive hemichannels in single oocytes. Intra-hemichannel interactions between mutant and wild-type proteins were assessed in rescue experiments using baculovirus expression in Sf9 insect cells. Of the four unstable mutations (C202F, I203T, L205V, N206S) only C202F and N206S formed stable hemichannels when co-expressed with wild-type Cx26. Stable M195T hemichannels displayed an increased tendency to aggregate.

In nine patients with PS or nonsyndromic EVA, a novel c.-103T-->C mutation in this regulatory element interferes with FOXI1 binding and completely abolishes FOXI1-mediated transcriptional activation. We have also identified six patients with mutations in FOXI1 that compromise its ability to activate SLC26A4 transcription. In one family, the EVA phenotype segregates in a double-heterozygous mode in the affected individual who carries single mutations in both SLC26A4 and FOXI1. This finding is consistent with our observation that EVA occurs in the Slc26a4(+/-); Foxi1(+/-) double-heterozygous mouse mutant.

OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of RUNX1 in the regulation of expression of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and to propose a plausible mechanism underlying RUNX1-mediated induction of the FPD phenotype.
METHODS: We assessed whether RUNX1 and its mutants, in combination with E26 transformation-specific-1 (ETS-1), Core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFβ), and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1), cooperatively regulate PF4 expression during megakaryocytic differentiation. In an embryonic stem cell differentiation system, expression levels of endogenous and exogenous RUNX1 and PF4 were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Promoter activation by the transcription factors were evaluated by reporter gene assays with HepG2 cells. DNA binding activity and protein interaction were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation assay with Cos-7 cells, respectively. Protein localization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting with Cos-7 cells.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that RUNX1 activates endogenous PF4 expression in megakaryocytic differentiation. RUNX1, but not its mutants, in combination with ETS-1 and CBFβ, or FLI-1, synergistically activated the PF4 promoter. Each RUNX1 mutant harbors various functional abnormalities, including loss of DNA-binding activity, abnormal subcellular localization, and/or alterations of binding affinities for ETS-1, CBFβ, and FLI-1.

Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles.

We used an expert-driven approach, exploiting all available information, to evaluate multigene panels for inherited cancer predisposition in a clinical series that included multiple cancer types and complex family histories.
METHODS: For 1,462 sequential patients referred for testing by BROCA or ColoSeq multigene panels, genomic DNA was sequenced and variants were interpreted by multiple experts using International Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines and incorporating evolutionary conservation, known and predicted variant consequences, and personal and family cancer history. Diagnostic yield was evaluated for various presenting conditions and family-history profiles.
RESULTS: Of 1,462 patients, 12% carried damaging mutations in established cancer genes. Diagnostic yield varied by clinical presentation. Actionable results were identified for 13% of breast and colorectal cancer patients and for 4% of cancer-free subjects, based on their family histories of cancer. Incidental findings explaining cancer in neither the patient nor the family were present in 1.7% of subjects. Less than 1% of patients carried VUS in BRCA1 or BRCA2. For all genes combined, initial reports contained VUS for 10.5% of patients, which declined to 7.5% of patients after reclassification based on additional information.

Our data indicate that a major developmental function of the Dbl domain is to inhibit EGF-dependent MAPK activation. The amount of inhibition conferred by the Dbl domain is equal to that of established trans-acting inhibitors of the EGFR pathway, including c-Cbl and RasGAP, and more than that of MAPK phosphatase. In conjunction with molecular modeling, our data suggest that the C. elegans mutation, as well as an equivalent mutation in human SOS1, activates the MAPK pathway by disrupting an autoinhibitory function of the Dbl domain on Ras activation.

Through whole-exome sequencing of DFNA2 families, we identified three novel KCNQ4 variants related to diverse auditory phenotypes in the proximal C-terminus (p.Arg331Gln), the C-terminus of the S6 segment (p.Gly319Asp), and the pore region (p.Ala271_Asp272del). Potassium currents in HEK293T cells expressing each KCNQ4 variant were recorded by patch-clamp, and functional recovery by PIP<sub>2</sub> expression or KCNQ openers was examined. In the homomeric expression setting, the three novel KCNQ4 mutant proteins lost conductance and were unresponsive to KCNQ openers or PIP<sub>2</sub> expression. Loss of p.Arg331Gln conductance was slightly restored by a tandem concatemer channel (WT-p.R331Q), and increased PIP<sub>2</sub> expression further increased the concatemer current to the level of the WT channel. Strikingly, an impaired homomeric p.Gly319Asp channel exhibited hyperactivity when a concatemer (WT-p.G319D), with a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Correspondingly, a KCNQ inhibitor and chelation of PIP<sub>2</sub> effectively downregulated the hyperactive WT-p.G319D concatemer channel.

Unlike wild-type p53, mutant p53(A347D) cannot form tetramers and exists as a hyperstable dimeric protein. Further, p53(A347D) cannot bind or transactivate the majority of canonical p53 target genes. Isogenic cell lines harboring either p53(A347D) or no p53 yield comparable tumorigenic properties, yet p53(A347D) displays remarkable neomorphic activities. Cells bearing p53(A347D) possess a distinct transcriptional profile and undergo metabolic reprogramming. Further, p53(A347D) induces striking mitochondrial network aberration and associates with mitochondria to drive apoptotic cell death upon topoisomerase II inhibition in the absence of transcription. Thus, dimer-forming p53 demonstrates both loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) properties compared with the wild-type form of the protein.
SIGNIFICANCE: A mutant p53 (A347D), which can only form dimers, is associated with increased cancer susceptibility in LFS individuals. We found that this mutant wields a double-edged sword, driving tumorigenesis through LOF while gaining enhanced apoptogenic activity as a new GOF, thereby yielding a potential vulnerability to select therapeutic approaches.

26752218,"Sequence alterations in the pendrin gene (SLC26A4) leading to functionally affected protein variants are frequently involved in the pathogenesis of syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness. Considering the high number of SLC26A4 sequence alterations reported to date, discriminating between functionally affected and unaffected pendrin protein variants is essential in contributing to determine the genetic cause of deafness in a given patient. In addition, identifying molecular features common to the functionally affected protein variants can be extremely useful to design future molecule-directed therapeutic approaches. Here we show the functional and molecular characterization of six previously uncharacterized pendrin protein variants found in a cohort of 58 Brazilian deaf patients. Two variants (p.T193I and p.L445W) were undetectable in the plasma membrane, completely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and showed no transport function; four (p.P142L, p.G149R, p.C282Y and p.Q413R) showed reduced function and significant, although heterogeneous, expression levels in the plasma membrane. Importantly, total expression levels of all of the functionally affected protein variants were significantly reduced with respect to the wild-type and a fully functional variant (p.R776C), regardless of their subcellular localization. Interestingly, reduction of expression may also reduce the transport activity of variants with an intrinsic gain of function (p.Q413R). As reduction of overall cellular abundance was identified as a common molecular feature of pendrin variants with affected function, the identification of strategies to prevent reduction in expression levels may represent a crucial step of potential future therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring the transport activity of dysfunctional pendrin variants.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
19204907,"Hearing loss with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) can be associated with mutations of the SLC26A4 gene encoding pendrin, a transmembrane Cl(-)/I(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger. Pendrin's critical transport substrates are thought to be I(-) in the thyroid gland and HCO(3)(-) in the inner ear. We previously reported that bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations are associated with Pendred syndromic EVA whereas one or zero mutant alleles are associated with nonsyndromic EVA. One study proposed a correlation of nonsyndromic EVA with SLC26A4 alleles encoding pendrin with residual transport activity. Here we describe the phenotypes and SLC26A4 genotypes of 47 EVA patients ascertained since our first report of 39 patients. We sought to determine the pathogenic potential of each variant in our full cohort of 86 patients. We evaluated the trafficking of 11 missense pendrin products expressed in COS-7 cells. Products that targeted to the plasma membrane were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for measurement of anion exchange activity. p.F335L, p.C565Y, p.L597S, p.M775T, and p.R776C had Cl(-)/I(-) and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange rate constants that ranged from 13 to 93% of wild type values. p.F335L, p.L597S, p.M775T and p.R776C are typically found as mono-allelic variants in nonsyndromic EVA. The high normal control carrier rate for p.L597S indicates it is a coincidentally detected nonpathogenic variant in this context. We observed moderate differential effects of hypo-functional variants upon exchange of HCO(3)(-) versus I(-) but their magnitude does not support a causal association with nonsyndromic EVA. However, these alleles could be pathogenic in trans configuration with a mutant allele in Pendred syndrome.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Here we show that stable BRAF-MEK1 complexes are enriched in BRAF(WT) and KRAS mutant (MT) cells but not in BRAF(MT) cells. The crystal structure of the BRAF(KD) in a complex with MEK1 reveals a face-to-face dimer sensitive to MEK1 phosphorylation but insensitive to BRAF dimerization. Structure-guided studies reveal that oncogenic BRAF mutations function by bypassing the requirement for BRAF dimerization for activity or weakening the interaction with MEK1. Finally, we show that conformation-specific BRAF inhibitors can sequester a dormant BRAF-MEK1 complex resulting in pathway inhibition. Taken together, these findings reveal a regulatory role for BRAF in the MAPK pathway independent of its kinase activity but dependent on interaction with MEK.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
19206169,"Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes (NS, LS, and CFCS) are developmental disorders with overlapping features including distinctive facial dysmorphia, reduced growth, cardiac defects, skeletal and ectodermal anomalies, and variable cognitive deficits. Dysregulated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal traffic has been established to represent the molecular pathogenic cause underlying these conditions. To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene. Besides the expected high prevalence of mutations observed among CFCS patients (52%), a de novo heterozygous missense change was identified in one subject with LS (17%) and five individuals with NS (1.9%). Mutations mapped to multiple protein domains and largely did not overlap with cancer-associated defects. NS-causing mutations had not been documented in CFCS, suggesting that the phenotypes arising from germline BRAF defects might be allele specific. Selected mutant BRAF proteins promoted variable gain of function of the kinase, but appeared less activating compared to the recurrent cancer-associated p.Val600Glu mutant. Our findings provide evidence for a wide phenotypic diversity associated with mutations affecting BRAF, and occurrence of a clinical continuum associated with these molecular lesions.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
22252923,"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease using recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) has resulted in increased survival although the clinical response is variable. Cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative status has been recognized as a poor prognostic factor. CRIM-negative patients make no GAA protein and develop sustained high antibody titers to ERT that render the treatment ineffective. Antibody titers are generally low for the majority of CRIM-positive patients and there is typically a better clinical outcome. Because immunomodulation has been found to be most effective in CRIM-negative patients prior to, or shortly after, initiation of ERT, knowledge of CRIM status is important before ERT is begun. We have analyzed 243 patients with infantile Pompe disease using a Western blot method for determining CRIM status and using cultured skin fibroblasts. Sixty-one out of 243 (25.1%) patients tested from various ethnic backgrounds were found to be CRIM-negative. We then correlated the CRIM results with GAA gene mutations where available (52 CRIM-negative and 88 CRIM-positive patients). We found that, in most cases, CRIM status can be predicted from GAA mutations, potentially circumventing the need for invasive skin biopsy and time wasted in culturing cells in the future. Continued studies in this area will help to increase the power of GAA gene mutations in predicting CRIM status as well as possibly identifying CRIM-positive patients who are at risk for developing high antibody titers.",PS3_strong,1,0,,1,
23430493,"Pompe disease (PD) is a recessive metabolic disorder characterized by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in all tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. PD clinical course is mainly determined by the nature of the GAA mutations. Although ~400 distinct GAA sequence variations have been described, the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always evident.In this study, we describe the first clinical and genetic analysis of Colombian PD patients performed in 11 affected individuals. GAA open reading frame sequencing revealed eight distinct mutations related to PD etiology including two novel missense mutations, c.1106 T > C (p.Leu369Pro) and c.2236 T > C (p.Trp746Arg). In vitro functional studies showed that the structural changes conferred by both mutations did not inhibit the synthesis of the 110 kD GAA precursor form but affected the processing and intracellular transport of GAA. In addition, analysis of previously described variants located at this position (p.Trp746Gly, p.Trp746Cys, p.Trp746Ser, p.Trp746X) revealed new insights in the molecular basis of PD. Notably, we found that p.Trp746Cys mutation, which was previously described as a polymorphism as well as a causal mutation, displayed a mild deleterious effect. Interestingly and by chance, our study argues in favor of a remarkable Afro-American and European ancestry of the Colombian population.

Four novel mutations (D645N, G448S, R672W, and R672Q) and a previously described mutation (C647W) were identified in five patients and their deleterious effect on enzyme expression demonstrated in vitro. Two novel frame-shifting insertions/deletions (delta nt766-785/insC and +insG@nt2243) were identified in two patients with exon 14 mutations. The remaining three patients were either homozygous for their mutations (D645N/D645 and C647W/C647W) or carried a previously described leaky splice site mutation (IVS1-13T-->G). For all patients ""in vivo"" enzyme activity was consistent with clinical phenotype. Agreement of genotype with phenotype and in vitro versus in vivo enzyme was seen in three patients (two infantile patients carrying C647W/C647W and D645N/+insG@nt2243 and an adult patient heteroallelic for G648S/IVS1-13T-->G). Relative discordance was found in a juvenile patient homozygous for the non-expressing R672Q and an adult patient heterozygous for the minimally expressing R672W and delta nt766-785/+insC. Possible explanations include differences in in vitro assays vs in vivo enzyme activity, tissue specific expression with diminished enzyme expression/stability in fibroblasts vs muscle, somatic mosaicism, and modifying genes.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

We found that gene-specific features can improve the performance of existing impact prediction tools that mostly rely on general features for pathogenicity prediction. Majority of the poorly predicted mutants that lower wildtype GAA enzyme activity occurred on the surface of the GAA protein. We also found that gene-specific features were uncorrelated with existing methods and provided orthogonal information for interpreting the origin of pathogenicity, particular in variants that are poorly predicted by existing general methods.

25348715,"A new model of kinase regulation based on the assembly of hydrophobic spines has been proposed. Changes in their positions can explain the mechanism of kinase activation. Here, we examined mutations in human cancer for clues about the regulation of the hydrophobic spines by focusing initially on mutations to Phe. We identified a selected number of Phe mutations in a small group of kinases that included BRAF, ABL1, and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Testing some of these mutations in BRAF, we found that one of the mutations impaired ATP binding and catalytic activity but promoted noncatalytic allosteric functions. Other Phe mutations functioned to promote constitutive catalytic activity. One of these mutations revealed a previously underappreciated hydrophobic surface that functions to position the dynamic regulatory αC-helix. This supports the key role of the C-helix as a signal integration motif for coordinating multiple elements of the kinase to create an active conformation. The importance of the hydrophobic space around the αC-helix was further tested by studying a V600F mutant, which was constitutively active in the absence of the negative charge that is associated with the common V600E mutation. Many hydrophobic mutations strategically localized along the C-helix can thus drive kinase activation.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

DNA sequencing analysis of the CDH1 gene revealed a splice site mutation(c.833-2A>G).

27304678,"The identification of biologically significant variants in cancer genomes is critical to therapeutic discovery, but it is limited by the statistical power needed to discern driver from passenger. Independent biological data can be used to filter cancer exomes and increase statistical power. Large genetic databases for inherited diseases are uniquely suited to this task because they contain specific amino acid alterations with known pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms. However, no rigorous method to overlay this information onto the cancer exome exists. Here, we present a computational methodology that overlays any variant database onto the somatic mutations in all cancer exomes. We validate the computation experimentally and identify novel associations in a re-analysis of 7362 cancer exomes. This analysis identified activating SOS1 mutations associated with Noonan syndrome as significantly altered in melanoma and the first kinase-activating mutations in ACVR1 associated with adult tumors.

28301459,"PURPOSE: Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by eyelid malformations, cleft lip/palate, and ectodermal dysplasia. The molecular basis of BCD syndrome remains unknown.
METHODS: We recruited 11 patients from 8 families and performed exome sequencing for 5 families with de novo BCD syndrome cases and targeted Sanger sequencing in the 3 remaining families.
RESULTS: We identified five CDH1 heterozygous missense mutations and three CTNND1 heterozygous truncating mutations leading to loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency. Establishment of detailed genotype-phenotype correlations was not possible because of the size of the cohort; however, the phenotype seems to appear more severe in case of CDH1 mutations. Functional analysis of CDH1 mutations confirmed their deleterious impact and suggested accelerated E-cadherin degradation.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in CDH1 encoding the E-cadherin were previously reported in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer as well as in nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate. Mutations in CTNND1 have never been reported before. The encoded protein, p120ctn, prevents E-cadherin endocytosis and stabilizes its localization at the cell surface. Conditional deletion of Cdh1 and Ctnnd1 in various animal models induces features reminiscent of BCD syndrome and underlines critical role of the E-cadherin-p120ctn interaction in eyelid, craniofacial, and tooth development.

17924342,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Most missense mutations result in misfolding of PAH, increased protein turnover, and a loss of enzymatic function. We studied the prediction of the energetic impact on PAH native-state stability of 318 PKU-associated missense mutations, using the protein-design algorithm FoldX. For the 80 mutations for which expression analyses have been performed in eukaryote systems, in most cases we found substantial overall correlations between the mutational energetic impact and both in vitro residual activities and patient metabolic phenotype. This finding confirmed that the decrease in protein stability is the main molecular pathogenic mechanism in PKU and the determinant for phenotypic outcome. Metabolic phenotypes have been shown to be better predicted than in vitro residual activities, probably because of greater stringency in the phenotyping process. Finally, all the remaining 238 PKU missense mutations compiled at the PAH locus knowledgebase (PAHdb) were analyzed, and their phenotypic outcomes were predicted on the basis of the energetic impact provided by FoldX. Residues in exons 7-9 and in interdomain regions within the subunit appear to play an important structural role and constitute hotspots for destabilization. FoldX analysis will be useful for predicting the phenotype associated with rare or new mutations detected in patients with PKU.

19691478,"BACKGROUND: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive inherited platelet function defect that is characterized by reduction in, or absence of, platelet aggregation in response to multiple physiologic agonists. The defect is caused by mutations in the genes encoding ITGA2B or ITGB3. This results in qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of the platelet receptor, alpha IIb-beta 3.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the mutations in GT patients and to correlate these with patient phenotype.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 unrelated patients with GT were enrolled in the present study to identify the causative molecular defects, and also to correlate their phenotype with their genotype. Platelet aggregation, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and mutation screening by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing were performed in all patients. Novel mutations were analyzed for penetrance in individual families.
RESULTS: A total of 22 novel mutations were identified in 45 unrelated GT patients. Mutations were identified in 36 of the 45 (80%) patients. Missense mutations were seen in most of the GT patients (59%). The remaining mutations were heterogeneous and were distributed throughout the length of the gene. Analysis of family members showed heterozygous mutations in all families.
CONCLUSIONS: The severe type I GT was the most common subtype found in this study. Missense mutations were identified as the defects responsible for most GT patients.

14690453,"Chemical or enzymic reduction/oxidation of integrin cysteine residues (e.g. by reducing agents and protein disulphide isomerase) may be a mechanism for regulating integrin function. It has also been proposed that unique cysteine residues in the integrin beta3 subunit are involved in the regulation of alphaIIbbeta3. In the present study, we studied systematically the role of disulphide bonds in beta3 on the ligand-binding function of alphaIIbbeta3 by mutating individual cysteine residues of beta3 to serine. We found that the disulphide bonds that are critical for alphaIIbbeta3 regulation are clustered within the EGF (epidermal growth factor) domains. Interestingly, disrupting only a single disulphide bond in the EGF domains was enough to activate alphaIIbbeta3 fully. In contrast, only two (of 13) disulphide bonds tested outside the EGF domains activated alphaIIbbeta3. These results suggest that the disulphide bonds in the EGF domains should be intact to keep alphaIIbbeta3 in an inactive state, and that there is no unique cysteine residue in the EGF domain critical for regulating the receptor. The cysteine residues in the EGF domains are potential targets for chemical or enzymic reduction.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Whereas an absence of expression or qualitative defects of αIIbβ3 mainly affect platelets and megakaryocytes, αvβ3 has a widespread tissue distribution. Little is known of how amino acid substitutions of β3 comparatively affect the expression and structure of both integrins. We now report computer modelling including molecular dynamics simulations of extracellular head domains of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 to determine the role of a novel β3 Pro189Ser (P163S in the mature protein) substitution that abrogates αIIbβ3 expression in platelets while allowing synthesis of αvβ3. Transfection of wild-type and mutated integrins in CHO cells confirmed that only αvβ3 surface expression was maintained. Modeling initially confirmed that replacement of αIIb by αv in the dimer results in a significant decrease in surface contacts at the subunit interface. For αIIbβ3, the presence of β3S163 specifically displaces an α-helix starting at position 259 and interacting with β3R261 while there is a moderate 11% increase in intra-subunit H-bonds and a very weak decrease in the global H-bond network. In contrast, for αvβ3, S163 has different effects with β3R261 coming deeper into the propeller with a 43% increase in intra-subunit H-bonds but with little effect on the global H-bond network. Compared to the WT integrins, the P163S mutation induces a small increase in the inter-subunit fluctuations for αIIbβ3 but a more rigid structure for αvβ3.

The patient has a severe bleeding history possibly aggravated by low VWF suggestive of associated type 1 von Willebrand's disease. Platelet aggregation was absent or severely reduced for all physiologic agonists. Flow cytometry showed an approximately 4% residual surface expression of alpha(IIb)beta(3). Western blotting confirmed a low platelet expression of both subunits. PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing showed no abnormalities in the beta(3) gene, but revealed a G-->A transition at a splice site [IVS 19 (+1)] of exon 19 in the alpha(IIb) gene. Of maternal inheritance, the splice site mutation was associated with intermediate levels of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in carriers. Unexpectedly, two G-->A transitions were detected in exon 29 of the alpha(IIb) gene and led to V(951)-->M and A(958)-->T amino acid substitutions. Family studies using restriction enzymes showed that both exon 29 mutations were paternal in origin and cosegregated across three generations. Transient expression in which mutated alpha(IIb) was cotransfected with wild-type beta(3) in COS-7 cells showed that V(951)-->M gave a much reduced surface expression of alpha(IIb)beta(3) and a block in the maturation of pro-alpha(IIb).

The beta(3) mutants beta(3)C177A, beta(3)C273A, and beta(3)C598Y exhibited a decreased electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, confirming the disruption of the respective disulfide loops. Despite reduced surface expression, the alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A, alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A, and alpha(IIb)beta(3)C598Y receptors mediated cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and translocated into focal adhesion plaques. The beta(3)C598Y mutation, but not the beta(3)C177A or beta(3)C273A mutations, induced spontaneous binding of the ligand mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC-1, while the beta(3)C177A and beta(3)C273A mutants exhibited reduced complex stability in the absence of Ca(2+). Epitope mapping of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) allowed the identification of two distinct subgroups; mAbs A2A9, pl2-46, 10E5, and P256 did not interact with alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A and bound only weakly to alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A, while mAbs AP2, LM609 and 7E3 bound normally to mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3)C273A, but interacted only weakly with mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A. Furthermore, a cryptic epitope recognized by mAb 4D10G3 and not exposed on wild type alpha(IIb)beta(3) became accessible only on mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3)C177A and was mapped to the 60-kDa chymotrypsin fragment of beta(3).

In contrast, disruption of each of the disulfide bonds in the two long insertions of the I-like domain predicted to be in close contact with the alpha subunit beta-propeller domain affect the stability of the alpha(IIb)beta(3) heterodimer and inhibit complex-specific mAb binding without affecting the RGD binding capacity of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

We analyzed the results in comparison with 111 missense variants in these genes previously reported as being associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), 20 associated with alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and 5 associated with aniso/macrothrombocytopenia.

We used receiver operating characteristic curves of combined annotation-dependent depletion, Polyphen 2-HDIV, and sorting intolerant from tolerant to estimate the percentage of novel variants likely to be deleterious. At optimal cut-off values, which had 69-98% sensitivity in detecting GT mutations, between 27% and 71% of the novel αIIb or β3 missense variants were predicted to be deleterious.

Soluble fibrinogen binding was no different between Pl(A1) and Pl(A2) cells, either in a resting state or when alpha(IIb)beta(3) was activated with anti-LIBS6. Pl(A1) and Pl(A2) cells bound equivalently to immobilized fibronectin. In contrast, significantly more Pl(A2) cells bound to immobilized fibrinogen in an alpha(IIb)beta(3)-dependent manner than did Pl(A1) cells. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D abolished the increased binding of Pl(A2) cells. Compared with Pl(A1) cells, Pl(A2) cells exhibited a greater extent of polymerized actin and cell spreading, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), and greater fibrin clot retraction. These adhesion differences appear to depend on a signaling mechanism sensitive to receptor occupancy. Thus, the Pl(A2) polymorphism altered integrin-mediated functions of adhesion, spreading, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and clot retraction.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
26115329,"The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a Ca2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle and is mutated in several diseases, including malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD). Most MH and CCD mutations cause accelerated Ca2+ release, resulting in abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle. However, how specific mutations affect the channel to produce different phenotypes is not well understood. In this study, we have investigated 11 mutations at 7 different positions in the amino (N)-terminal region of RyR1 (9 MH and 2 MH/CCD mutations) using a heterologous expression system in HEK293 cells. In live-cell Ca2+ imaging at room temperature (~25 °C), cells expressing mutant channels exhibited alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, i.e., an enhanced sensitivity to caffeine, a depletion of Ca2+ in the ER and an increase in resting cytoplasmic Ca2+. RyR1 channel activity was quantitatively evaluated by [3H]ryanodine binding and three parameters (sensitivity to activating Ca2+, sensitivity to inactivating Ca2+ and attainable maximum activity, i.e., gain) were obtained by fitting analysis. The mutations increased the gain and the sensitivity to activating Ca2+ in a site-specific manner. The gain was consistently higher in both MH and MH/CCD mutations. Sensitivity to activating Ca2+ was markedly enhanced in MH/CCD mutations. The channel activity estimated from the three parameters provides a reasonable explanation to the pathological phenotype assessed by Ca2+ homeostasis. These properties were also observed at higher temperatures (~37 °C). Our data suggest that divergent activity profiles may cause varied disease phenotypes by specific mutations. This approach should be useful for diagnosis and treatment of diseases with mutations in RyR1.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
31607937,"Mice (Y522S or YS), carrying a mutation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle fibers (ryanodine receptor type-1, RyR1) which causes Ca2+ leak, are a widely accepted and intensively studied model for human malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. Since the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of mitochondria in MH crisis has been previously debated, here we sought to determine Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria and its possible link with ROS production in single fibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) of YS mice. We found that Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, as detected with the ratiometric FRET-based 4mtD3cpv probe, was higher in YS than in wild-type (WT) fibers at rest and after Ca2+ release from SR during repetitive electrical stimulation or caffeine administration. Also mitochondrial ROS production associated with contractile activity (detected with Mitosox probe) was much higher in YS fibers than in WT. Importantly, the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake achieved by silencing MCU reduced ROS accumulation in the matrix and Ca2+ release from SR. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS accumulation using Mitotempo reduced SR Ca2+ release in YS fibers exposed to caffeine. The present results support the view that mitochondria take up larger amounts of Ca2+ in YS than in WT fibers and that mitochondrial ROS production substantially contributes to the increased caffeine-sensitivity and to the enhanced Ca2+ release from SR in YS fibers.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
9334205,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) are autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal muscle in which a potentially fatal hypermetabolic crisis can be triggered by commonly used anesthetic agents. To date, 17 mutations in the human RYR1 gene encoding the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (the ryanodine receptor) have been associated with MH and/or CCD. Although many of these mutations have been linked to MH and/or CCD, with high lod (log of the odds favoring linkage versus nonlinkage) scores, others have been found in single, small families. Independent biochemical evidence for a causal role for these mutations in MH is available for only two mutants. Mutations corresponding to the human MH mutations were made in a full-length rabbit RYR1 cDNA, and wild type and mutant cDNAs were transfected into HEK-293 cells. After about 48 h, intact cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, and intracellular Ca2+ release, induced by caffeine or halothane, was measured by photometry. Ca2+ release in cells expressing MH or CCD mutant ryanodine receptors was invariably significantly more sensitive to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane than Ca2+ release in cells expressing wild type receptors or receptors mutated in other regions of the molecule. Linear regression analysis showed that there is a strong correlation (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) between caffeine sensitivity of different RYR1 mutants measured by the cellular Ca2+ photometry assay and by the clinical in vitro caffeine halothane contracture test (IVCT). The correlation was weaker, however, for halothane (r = 0.49, p > 0.05). Abnormal sensitivity in the Ca2+ photometry assay provides supporting evidence for a causal role in MH for each of 15 single amino acid mutations in the ryanodine receptor. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the cellular Ca2+ photometry assay in the assessment of the sensitivity to caffeine and halothane of specific ryanodine receptor mutants.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
31841587,"Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1) is a Ca2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle and plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the RYR1 gene cause severe muscle diseases such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), which is a disorder of CICR via RYR1. Thus far, >300 mutations in RYR1 have been reported in patients with MH. However, owing to a lack of comprehensive analysis of the structure-function relationship of mutant RYR1, the mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we combined functional studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RYR1 bearing disease-associated mutations at the N-terminal region. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the mutant RYR1 caused abnormalities in Ca2+ homeostasis. MD simulations of WT and mutant RYR1s were performed using crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) monomer, consisting of A, B, and C domains. We found that the mutations located around the interdomain region differentially affected hydrogen bonds/salt bridges. Particularly, mutations at R402, which increase the open probability of the channel, cause clockwise rotation of BC domains with respect to the A domain by alteration of the interdomain interactions. Similar results were also obtained with artificial mutations that mimic alteration of the interactions. Our results reveal the importance of interdomain interactions within the NTD in the regulation of the RYR1 channel and provide insights into the mechanism of MH caused by the mutations at the NTD.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
9873004,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) mutations were introduced into full-length rabbit Ca2+ release channel (RYR1) cDNA, which was then expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells. Resting Ca2+ concentrations were higher in HEK-293 cells expressing homotetrameric CCD mutant RyR1 than in cells expressing homotetrameric MH mutant RyR1. Cells expressing homotetrameric CCD or MH mutant RyR1 exhibited lower maximal peak amplitudes of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release than cells expressing wild type RyR1, suggesting that MH and CCD mutants might be ""leaky."" In cells expressing homotetrameric wild type or mutant RyR1, the amplitude of 10 mM caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was correlated significantly with the amplitude of carbachol- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release, indicating that maximal drug-induced Ca2+ release depends on the size of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. The content of endogenous sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2b (SERCA2b), measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 45Ca2+ uptake, and confocal microscopy, was increased in HEK-293 cells expressing wild type or mutant RyR1, supporting the view that endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage capacity is increased as a compensatory response to an enhanced Ca2+ leak. When heterotetrameric (1:1) combinations of MH/CCD mutant and wild type RyR1 were expressed together with SERCA1 to enhance Ca2+ reuptake, the amplitude of Ca2+ release in response to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane was higher than that observed in cells expressing wild type RyR1 and SERCA1. In Ca2+-free medium, MH/CCD mutants were more sensitive to caffeine than wild type RyR1, indicating that caffeine hypersensitivity observed with a variety of MH/CCD mutant RyR1 proteins is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ concentration.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

RT-PCR and subsequent cloning experiments were performed to investigate whether this variant completely disrupts normal splicing. This variant preferentially abolishes normal splicing through activation of a cryptic 3' acceptor splice site within exon 6 of CDH1, presumably leading to a premature protein truncation within first extracellular domain repeat of E-cadherin protein.

However, identification of variants that impact splicing remains a challenge, contributing to a substantial proportion of patients with suspected hereditary cancer syndromes remaining without a molecular diagnosis. To address this, we used capture RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate a splicing profile of 18 TSGs (APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53) in 345 whole-blood samples from healthy donors. We subsequently demonstrated that this approach can detect mis-splicing by comparing splicing profiles from the control dataset to profiles generated from whole blood of individuals previously identified with pathogenic germline splicing variants in these genes. To assess the utility of our TSG splicing profile to prospectively identify pathogenic splicing variants, we performed concurrent capture DNA and RNA-seq in a cohort of 1000 patients with suspected hereditary cancer syndromes. This approach improved the diagnostic yield in this cohort, resulting in a 9.1% relative increase in the detection of pathogenic variants, demonstrating the utility of performing simultaneous DNA and RNA genetic testing in a clinical context.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
31843900,"Mutations responsible for inherited disease may act by disrupting normal transcriptional splicing. Such mutations can be difficult to detect, and their effects difficult to characterize, because many lie deep within exons or introns where they may alter splice enhancers or silencers or introduce new splice acceptors or donors. Multiple mutation-specific and genome-wide approaches have been developed to evaluate these classes of mutations. We introduce a complementary experimental approach, cBROCA, which yields qualitative and quantitative assessments of the effects of genomic mutations on transcriptional splicing of tumor suppressor genes. cBROCA analysis is undertaken by deriving complementary DNA (cDNA) from puromycin-treated patient lymphoblasts, hybridizing the cDNA to the BROCA panel of tumor suppressor genes, and then multiplex sequencing to very high coverage. At each splice junction suggested by split sequencing reads, read depths of test and control samples are compared. Significant Z scores indicate altered transcripts, over and above naturally occurring minor transcripts, and comparisons of read depths indicate relative abundances of mutant and normal transcripts. BROCA analysis of genomic DNA suggested 120 rare mutations from 150 families with cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus, or colon, in >600 informative genotyped relatives. cBROCA analysis of their transcripts revealed a wide variety of consequences of abnormal splicing in tumor suppressor genes, including whole or partial exon skipping, exonification of intronic sequence, loss or gain of exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers, complete intron retention, hypomorphic alleles, and combinations of these alterations.

25198162,"ETHE1 is an iron-containing protein from the metallo β-lactamase family involved in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway. Mutations in ETHE1 causing loss of function result in sulfide toxicity and in the rare fatal disease Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy (EE). Frequently mutations resulting in depletion of ETHE1 in patient cells are due to severe structural and folding defects. However, some ETHE1 mutations yield nearly normal protein levels and in these cases disease mechanism was suspected to lie in compromised catalytic activity. To address this issue and to elicit how ETHE1 dysfunction results in EE, we have investigated two such pathological mutations, ETHE1-p.Arg163Gln and p.Arg163Trp. In addition, we report a number of benchmark properties of wild type human ETHE1, including for the first time the redox properties of the mononuclear iron centre. We show that loss of function in these variants results from a combination of decreased protein stability and activity. Although structural assessment revealed that the protein fold is not perturbed by mutations, both variants have decreased thermal stabilities and higher proteolytic susceptibilities. ETHE1 wild type and variants bind 1 ± 0.2 mol iron/protein and no zinc; however, the variants exhibited only ≈ 10% of wild-type catalytically activity. Analysis of the redox properties of ETHE1 mononuclear iron centre revealed that the variants have lowered reduction potentials with respect to that of the wild type. This illustrates how point mutation-induced loss of function may arise via very discrete subtle conformational effects on the protein fold and active site chemistry, without extensive disruption of the protein structure or protein-cofactor association.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

A de novo autism-linked missense mutation disrupts this phosphorylation site, causing enhanced UBE3A activity in vitro, enhanced substrate turnover in patient-derived cells, and excessive dendritic spine development in the brain.

In this report we examine the consequences of these mutations on the function of MeCP2. The ability to bind specifically to methylated DNA and the transcription repression capabilities are tested, as well as the stability of proteins in vivo. We find that all missense mutations (R106W, R133C, F155S, T158M) within the methyl-binding domain impair selectivity for methylated DNA, and that all nonsense mutations (L138X, R168X, E235X, R255X, R270X, V288X, R294X) that truncate all or some of the transcriptional repression domain (TRD) affect the ability to repress transcription and have decreased levels of stability in vivo. Two missense mutations, one in the TRD (R306C) and one in the C-terminus (E397K), had no noticeable effects on MeCP2 function. Together, these results provide evidence of how Rett syndrome mutations can affect distinct functions of MeCP2 and give insight into these mutations that may contribute to the disease.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25584008,"PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pediatric malignancy. It occurs in excess among individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which results primarily from germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Prior series exploring frequencies of germline TP53 mutation among children with ACC have been small, geographically limited, or subject to referral bias. The functional consequence of mutations has not been related to phenotype. We provide a genotype-phenotype analysis of TP53 mutations in pediatric ACC and propose a model for tissue-specific effects based on adrenocortical ontogeny.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive, unrelated children with ACC, unselected for family history, underwent germline TP53 sequencing. Rate and distribution of mutations were identified. Functional analysis was performed for novel TP53 variants. Correlation with the International Agency for Research on Cancer p53 database further delineated mutational distribution, association with family history, and risk for multiple primary malignancies (MPMs).
RESULTS: Germline mutations were present in 50% of children. These mutations did not correspond to the conventional hotspot mutations. There was a wide range of mutant protein function. Patients bearing alleles encoding protein with higher functionality were less likely to have a strong family cancer history, whereas those with greater loss of function had MPMs and/or positive family history. In patients with MPMs, ACC was the most frequent initial malignancy. Finally, we demonstrated age-dependent rates of TP53 mutation positivity.
CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are prevalent in children with ACC but decline with age. Mutations result in a broad spectrum of functional loss. Effect of individual mutations may predict carrier and familial disease penetrance with potentially broad implications for clinical surveillance and counseling.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
25386756,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal codominant disease with a frequency of 1:500 individuals in its heterozygous form. The genetic basis of FH is most commonly mutations within the LDLR gene. Assessing the pathogenicity of LDLR variants is particularly important to give a patient a definitive diagnosis of FH. Current studies of LDLR activity ex vivo are based on the analysis of 125I-labeled lipoproteins (reference method) or fluorescent-labelled LDL. The main purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of these two methods to assess LDLR functionality in order to validate a functional assay to analyse LDLR mutations. LDLR activity of different variants has been studied by flow cytometry using FITC-labelled LDL and compared with studies performed previously with 125I-labeled lipoproteins. Flow cytometry results are in full agreement with the data obtained by the 125I methodology. Additionally confocal microscopy allowed the assignment of different class mutation to the variants assayed. Use of fluorescence yielded similar results than 125I-labeled lipoproteins concerning LDLR activity determination, and also allows class mutation classification. The use of FITC-labelled LDL is easier in handling and disposal, cheaper than radioactivity and can be routinely performed by any group doing LDLR functional validations.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
12522687,"Lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in plasma generally reflect complex influences of multiple genetic loci. Even an autosomal dominant disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity, as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels vary widely within the same pedigree. Molecular screening for LDL receptor ( LDLR) mutations among 75 patients with clinically apparent FH led to identification of a novel splice-site mutation (IVS14+1 G>A) shared by 14 patients. Genealogical research confirmed that all 14 carriers were part of the same 1135-member pedigree with a common ancestor. The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein, reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele. Of the 208 members of the kindred who were screened for the presence of this LDLR mutation, we identified 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers. Nine principal apolipoprotein genes that might affect LDL cholesterol differentially according to LDL-receptor status were examined in this pedigree. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values were observed among the majority of the LDLR mutation carriers who were simultaneously homozygous for the -265C variant of apoA-II (total cholesterol: 324 +/- 8 vs 244 +/- 19 mg/dl, P = 0.0015; LDL-cholesterol: 237 +/- 8 vs 155 +/- 18 mg/dl, P = 0.0008). In vitro transfection assays showed that transcriptional activity of the apoA-II promoter was reduced by 30% in the -265C variant as compared with the -265T variant.

In this study, efforts were directed to determine if there were other common LDL receptor mutations in this population. Three missense mutations were identified and each mutation was reproduced and expressed in vitro. Two of the three mutations result in the production of an LDL receptor protein that is not processed to its mature form at a normal rate. Molecular assays were developed to detect the mutations directly, and the LDL receptor genes of 130 French Canadian FH heterozygotes were screened for the presence of the three missense mutations as well as two deletions.

We found that proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin blocked the degradation of the LDLR mutants, but not that of the wild-type LDLR. Treatment of CHO cells with these proteasome inhibitors led to a significant accumulation of the mutants at steady state. Furthermore, cell surface levels of the LDLR mutants were significantly increased upon inhibition of the proteasome degradation pathway. In contrast to the proteasome inhibitors, inhibitors of trypsin-like proteases, chymotrypsin-like proteases, and lysosomal pathway inhibitors did not affect the levels of the LDLR mutants.

Mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause the disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Approximately 50% of the mutations in the LDL receptor gene in patients with FH lead to receptor proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Misfolding of mutant LDL receptors is a probable cause of this ER retention, resulting in no functional LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, the specific factors and mechanisms responsible for retention of mutant LDL receptors are unknown. In the present study we show that the molecular chaperone Grp78/BiP co-immunoprecipitates with both the wild type and two different mutant (W556S and C646Y) LDL receptors in lysates obtained from human liver cells overexpressing wild type or mutant LDL receptors. A pulse-chase study shows that the interaction between the wild type LDL receptor and Grp78 is no longer detectable after 2(1/2) h, whereas it persists for more than 4 h with the mutant receptors. Furthermore, about five times more Grp78 is co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptors than with the wild type receptor suggesting that Grp78 is involved in retention of mutant LDL receptors in the ER. Overexpression of Grp78 causes no major alterations on the steady state level of active LDL receptors at the cell surface. However, overexpression of Grp78 decreases the processing rate of newly synthesized wild type LDL receptors. This indicates that the Grp78 interaction is a rate-limiting step in the maturation of the wild type LDL receptor and that Grp78 may be an important factor in the quality control of newly synthesized LDL receptors.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

In addition, we characterized both novel and known mutations in the LDLR gene. T-lymphocytes and EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of 24 FH patients and 24 control subjects. Functional assays were performed by incubation with fluorescent LDL followed by flow cytometry analysis. Residual LDLR activity was calculated normalizing fluorescence for the mean fluorescence of controls. With stimulated T-lymphocytes we obtained a better discrimination capacity between controls and FH patients compared with EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes as demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (the areas under the curve are 1.000 and 0.984 respectively; P < 0.0001 both). The characterization of LDLR activity through T-lymphocytes is more simple and faster than the use of EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes and allows a complete discrimination between controls and FH patients.

A phase 2, proof-of-concept study (NCT02265952) demonstrated that evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3 protein), reduced LDL-C levels in 9 patients with genotypically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well tolerated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of evinacumab on LDLR activity in lymphocytes purified from patients in the proof-of-concept study. Approach and Results: LDLR activity was assessed in patient lymphocytes before and after treatment with evinacumab and versus lymphocytes carrying wild-type LDLR, and also in an LDLR-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-ldlA7) transfected with plasmids encoding the LDLR variants. Overall mean peak reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab was -58±18%, occurring between Week 4 and Week 12. Mutations identified in the 9 patients were shown to be pathogenic, with loss of LDLR activity versus wild type. Two of the LDLR variants, p.(Cys681*) and p.(Ala627Profs*38), were class 2 type mutations that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six variants were class 3 type mutations with impaired LDL-C binding activity: p.(Trp87Gly), occurring in 2 patients, p.(Gln254Pro), p.(Ser177Leu), p.(Gly335Val), and p.(Ser306Leu). Evinacumab had no effect on LDLR activity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that evinacumab is effective for lowering LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and the inhibition of ANGPTL3 in humans lowers LDL-C in a mechanism independent of the LDLR.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
30413722,"Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder caused most often by mutations in the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor gene (LDLr) leading to high blood cholesterol levels, and ultimately to development of premature coronary heart disease. Genetic analysis and subsequent cascade screening in relatives allow diagnosis of FH at early stage, especially relevant to diagnose children. So far, more than 2300 LDLr variants have been described but only a minority of them have been functionally analysed to evaluate their pathogenicity in FH. Thus, identifying pathogenic mutations in LDLr is a long-standing challenge in the field. In this study, we investigated in vitro the activity p.(Asp47Asn) and p.(Thr62Met) LDLr variants, both in the LR1 region. We used CHO-ldlA7 transfected cells with plasmids carrying p.(Asp47Asn) or p.(Thr62Met) LDLr variants to analyse LDLr expression by FACS and immunoblotting, LDL binding and uptake was determined by FACS and analysis of mutation effects was assessed in silico. The in vitro activity assessment of p.(Asp47Asn) and p.(Thr62Met) LDLr variants shows a fully functional LDL binding and uptake activities. Therefore indicating that the three of them are non-pathogenic LDLr variants. These findings also emphasize the importance of in vitro functional LDLr activity studies to optimize the genetic diagnosis of FH avoiding the report of non-pathogenic variants and possible misdiagnose in relatives if cascade screening is carried out.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
34572405,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common genetic disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by increased levels of total and LDL plasma cholesterol, which leads to premature atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. FH phenotype has considerable genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability, depending on LDL receptor activity and lifestyle. To improve diagnosis and patient management, here, we characterized two single nucleotide missense substitutions at Methionine 1 of the human LDLR gene (c.1A&gt;T/p.(Met1Leu) and c.1A&gt;C/p.(Met1Leu)). We used a combination of Western blot, flow cytometry, and luciferase assays to determine the effects of both variants on the expression, activity, and synthesis of LDLR. Our data show that both variants can mediate translation initiation, although the expression of variant c.1A&gt;T is very low. Both variants are in the translation initiation codon and codify for the same amino acid p.(Met1Leu), yet they lead to different levels of impairment on LDLR expression and activity, corroborating different efficiencies of the translation initiation at these non-canonical initiation codons. The functional data of these variants allowed for an improved American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) classification for both variants, which can allow a more personalized choice of the lipid-lowering treatment and dyslipidemia management, ultimately improving patients' prognosis.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
16359514,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by lack or dysfunction of alpha(IIb)beta3 in platelets. GT is relatively frequent in highly inbred populations. We previously identified a 13-bp deletion in the alpha(IIb) gene that causes in-frame deletion of six amino acids in three Palestinian GT patients. In this study, we determined the molecular basis of GT in all known Palestinian patients, examined whether Jordanian patients harbor the same mutations, analyzed whether there is a founder effect for the 13-bp deletion, and determined the mechanism by which the 13-bp deletion abolishes alpha(IIb)beta3 surface expression. Of 11 unrelated Palestinian patients, eight were homozygous for the 13-bp deletion that displayed common ancestry by haplotype analysis, and was estimated to have occurred 300-600 years ago. Expression studies in baby hamster kidney cells showed that substitution of Cys107 or Trp110 located within the deletion caused defective alpha(IIb)beta3 maturation. Substitution of Trp110, but not of Cys107, prevented fibrinogen binding. The other Palestinian patients harbored three novel mutations: G2374 deletion in alpha(IIb) gene, TT1616-7 deletion in beta3 gene, and IVS14: -3C --> G in beta3 gene. The latter mutation caused cryptic splicing predicting an extended cytoplasmic tail of beta3 and was expressed as dysfunctional alpha(IIb)beta(3). None of 15 unrelated Jordanian patients carried any of the described mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
8282784,"We studied the defect responsible for Glanzmann thrombasthenia in a patient whose platelets expressed < 5% of the normal amount of GPIIb-IIIa. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that the patient's GPIIIa genes were normal. However, DNA analysis revealed the patient homozygous for a G818-->A substitution in her GPIIb genes, resulting in a Gly273-->Asp substitution adjacent to the first GPIIb calcium-binding domain. To determine how this mutation impaired GPIIb-IIIa expression, recombinant GPIIb containing the mutation was coexpressed with GPIIIa in COS-1 cells. The GPIIb mutant formed stable GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers that were not immunoprecipitated by either of two heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the mutation disrupted the epitopes for these antibodies. Moreover, the GPIIb in the heterodimers was not cleaved into heavy and light chains, indicating that the heterodimers were not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex where GPIIb cleavage occurs, nor were the mutant heterodimers expressed on the cell surface. These studies demonstrate that a Gly273-->Asp mutation in GPIIb does not prevent the assembly of GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers, but alters the conformation of these heterodimers sufficiently to impair their intracellular transport. The impaired GPIIb-IIIa transport is responsible for the thrombasthenia in this patient.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
27857962,"Malignant hyperthermia manifests as a rapid and sustained rise in temperature in response to pharmacological triggering agents, e.g. inhalational anesthetics and the muscle relaxant suxamethonium. Other clinical signs include an increase in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption, as well as tachycardia, and if untreated a malignant hyperthermia episode can result in death. The metabolic changes are caused by dysregulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis, resulting from a defective ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel, which resides in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and controls the flux of Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores to the cytoplasm. Most genetic variants associated with susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia occur in the RYR1 gene encoding the ryanodine receptor type 1. While malignant hyperthermia susceptibility can be diagnosed by in vitro contracture testing of skeletal muscle biopsy tissue, it is advantageous to use DNA testing. Currently only 35 of over 400 potential variants in RYR1 have been classed as functionally causative of malignant hyperthermia and thus can be used for DNA diagnostic tests. Here we describe functional analysis of 2 RYR1 variants (c. 7042_7044delCAG, p.ΔGlu2348 and c.641C&gt;T, p.Thr214Met) that occur in the same malignant hyperthermia susceptible family. The p.Glu2348 deletion, causes hypersensitivity to ryanodine receptor agonists using in vitro analysis of cloned human RYR1 cDNA expressed in HEK293T cells, while the Thr214Met substitution, does not appear to significantly alter sensitivity to agonist in the same system. We suggest that the c. 7042_7044delCAG, p.ΔGlu2348 RYR1 variant could be added to the list of diagnostic mutations for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
36208971,"BACKGROUND: A major bottleneck to the introduction of noninvasive presymptomatic diagnostic tests for the pharmacogenetic disorder malignant hyperthermia is the lack of functional data for associated variants.
METHODS: We screened 50 genes having a potential role in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis using the HaloPlex™ (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) target enrichment system and next-generation sequencing. Twenty-one patients with a history of a clinical malignant hyperthermia reaction together with a positive in vitro contracture test were included. Eight variants in RYR1 were subsequently introduced into the cDNA for the human ryanodine receptor gene and tested in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells for their effect on calcium release from intracellular stores in response to the ryanodine receptor-1 agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol using fura-2 as calcium indicator. Each variant was subjected to in silico curation using the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group scoring matrix and ClinGen RYR1 variant curation expert panel guidelines.
RESULTS: Potentially causative RYR1 variants were identified in 15 patients. Of these, two families carried two RYR1 variants, five variants had been previously reported as 'pathogenic', two variants had been previously reported as 'likely benign', and eight were of 'uncertain significance'. Of these eight variants, four showed hypersensitivity to 4-chloro-m-cresol. Three variants were reclassified as either 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic'. Two were classified as 'benign', whilst three remained of 'uncertain significance'.
CONCLUSIONS: Three (p.Tyr1711Cys, p.Val2280Ile, and p.Arg4737Gln) additional variants can be added to the list of RYR1 disease-associated variants managed by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group. These can therefore be used diagnostically in the future. Three variants (p.Glu2348Gly, p.Asn2634Lys, and p.Arg3629Trp) that remained classified as of uncertain significance require further family studies or a different functional test to determine clinical relevance in malignant hyperthermia.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
33490280,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the potential safety of remimazolam and propofol in malignant hyperthermia- (HM-) susceptible patients using ryanodine receptor 1- (RYR1-) expressing human embryonic kidney- (HEK-) 293 cells.
METHODS: We compared the enhanced responsiveness of HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type RYR1 with that of mutant RYR1 to caffeine following perfusion with remimazolam or propofol. Furthermore, we investigated whether RYR1 enhanced the responsiveness of cells to remimazolam or propofol and compared the median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>; i.e., the concentration required to reach half-maximal activation) using an unpaired two-tailed t-test while a P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Remimazolam and propofol did not promote the caffeine-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in HEK-293 cells expressing mutant RYR1 even with exposure to approximately 100-fold the clinically used concentration. In wild-type RYR1, EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam following refusion vs. nonperfusion were 2.86 mM vs. 2.75 mM (P = 0.76) while for propofol perfusion vs. nonperfusion, they were 2.76 mM vs. 2.75 mM, respectively (P = 0.83). In mutant RYR1, EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam refusion vs. nonperfusion were 1.58 mM vs. 1.71 mM, respectively (P = 0.63) while for propofol perfusion vs. nonperfusion, they were 1.65 mM vs. 1.71 mM, respectively (P = 0.73). Remimazolam and propofol increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in a concentration-dependent manner, but the effect was not enhanced by RYR1. EC<sub>50</sub> values of remimazolam with non-RYR1 vs. wild-type RYR1 were 1.00 mM vs. 0.92 mM, respectively (P = 0.91) while those of propofol were 1.09 mM vs. 1.05 mM, respectively (P = 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration caused by remimazolam or propofol was not considered an RYR1-mediated reaction. We conclude that remimazolam and propofol can be safely used as an anesthetic in MH-susceptible patients with RYR1-mutation without causing MH and may be safely substituted for an MH-triggering anesthetic when RYR1-mediated MH occurs.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
8094613,"Glycogen-storage disease type II (GSDII) is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). This paper reports on the analysis of the mutant alleles in an American black patient with an adult form of GSDII (GM1935). The lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor of this patient has abnormal molecular features: (i) the molecular mass is decreased, (ii) the phosphorylation is deficient and (iii) the proteolytic processing is impaired. Sequence analysis revealed four mutations leading to amino acid alterations: Asp-645-->Glu, Val-816-->Ile, Arg-854-->Stop and Thr-927-->Ile. By using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on PCR-amplified cDNA we have demonstrated that the Arg-854-->Stop mutation is located in one allele that is not expressed, and that the other allele contains the remaining three mutations. Each of the mutations was introduced in wild-type cDNA and expressed in COS cells to analyse the effect on biosynthesis, transport and phosphorylation of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. The Val-816-->Ile substitution appeared to have no significant effect in contrast with results [Martiniuk, Mehler, Bodkin, Tzall, Hirshhorn, Zhong and Hirschhorn (1991) DNA Cell Biol. 10, 681-687] and was therefore defined as a polymorphism. The Thr-927-->Ile substitution deleting one of the seven glycosylation sites was found to be responsible for the decrease in molecular-mass, but not for the deficient proteolytic processing and phosphorylation. It did not cause the enzyme deficiency either. The third mutation leading to the Asp-645-->Glu substitution was proven to account in full for the observed defects in transport, phosphorylation and proteolytic processing of the newly synthesized alpha-glucosidase precursor of the patient.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
8078883,"A point mutation in the mtDNA-encoded ATP6 gene (T-->G at nt 8993) associated with Leigh syndrome in two pedigrees was found to decrease ADP-stimulated (state III) respiration and the ratio of ADP molecules phosphorylated to oxygen atoms reduced (ADP/O ratio) but did not affect 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)-uncoupled respiration, suggesting a defective mitochondrial H(+)-translocating ATP synthase. Intact mitochondria isolated from patient and control lymphoblastoid cell lines were tested for state III, ADP-limited (state IV), and DNP-uncoupled respiration with various substrates. Mitochondria isolated from patient lymphoblasts harboring 95-100% of mtDNAs carrying the nt 8993 T-->G mutation showed state III respiration rates 26-50% lower than controls while having normal DNP-uncoupled rates. This resulted in state III/DNP ratios of 0.52-0.70 in patient mitochondria versus 0.88-0.97 in controls. The ADP/O ratio was also decreased 30-40% in patient mitochondria. Patient lymphoblasts heteroplasmic for the nt 8993 mutation were enucleated by using Percoll gradients and the cytoplasts were fused to mtDNA-deficient (rho 0) cells by electric shock. Cybrid clones homoplasmic for the wild-type nucleotide (T) at nt 8993 gave state III/DNP and ADP/O ratios similar to those of control cybrids, whereas cybrid clones homoplasmic for the mutant nucleotide (G) showed a 24-53% reduction in state III respiration, a state III/DNP ratio of 0.53-0.64, and a 30% decrease in the ADP/O ratio. Thus, the reduced state III respiration rates and ADP/O ratios are linked to the T-->G mutation at nt 8993.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
19875463,"Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded subunit 6 of ATPase (ATP6) are associated with variable disease expression, ranging from adult onset neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) to fatal childhood maternally inherited Leigh's syndrome (MILS). Phenotypical variations have largely been attributed to mtDNA heteroplasmy. However, there is often a discrepancy between the levels of mutant mtDNA and disease severity. Therefore, the correlation among genetic defect, bioenergetic impairment and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS remains to be elucidated. We investigated the bioenergetics of cybrids from five patients carrying different ATP6 mutations: three harboring the T8993G, one with the T8993C and one with the T9176G mutation. The bioenergetic defects varied dramatically, not only among different ATP6 mutants, but also among lines carrying the same T8993G mutation. Mutants with the most severe ATP synthesis impairment showed defective respiration and disassembly of respiratory chain complexes. This indicates that respiratory chain defects modulate the bioenergetic impairment in NARP/MILS cells. Sequencing of the entire mtDNA from the different mutant cell lines identified variations in structural genes, resulting in amino acid changes that destabilize the respiratory chain. Taken together, these results indicate that the mtDNA background plays an important role in modulating the biochemical defects and clinical outcome in NARP/MILS.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16183799,"Mutations in ETHE1, a gene located at chromosome 19q13, have recently been identified in patients affected by ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). EE is a devastating infantile metabolic disorder, characterised by widespread lesions in the brain, hyperlactic acidaemia, petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and high levels of ethylmalonic acid in body fluids. To investigate to what extent ETHE1 is responsible for EE, we analysed this gene in 29 patients with typical EE and in 11 patients presenting with early onset progressive encephalopathy with ethylmalonic aciduria (non-EE EMA). Frameshift, stop, splice site, and missense mutations of ETHE1 were detected in all the typical EE patients analysed. Western blot analysis of the ETHE1 protein indicated that some of the missense mutations are associated with the presence of the protein, suggesting that the corresponding wild type amino acid residues have a catalytic function. No ETHE1 mutations were identified in non-EE EMA patients. Experiments based on two dimensional blue native electrophoresis indicated that ETHE1 protein works as a supramolecular, presumably homodimeric, complex, and a three dimensional model of the protein suggests that it is likely to be a mitochondrial matrix thioesterase acting on a still unknown substrate. Finally, the 625G-->A single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding the short chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCAD) was previously proposed as a co-factor in the aetiology of EE and other EMA syndromes. SNP analysis in our patients ruled out a pathogenic role of SCAD variants in EE, but did show a highly significant prevalence of the 625A alleles in non-EE EMA patients.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We identified a single AKT1 E17K mutation. Remarkably, a previously unidentified AKT3 E17K mutation was detected in two melanomas (from one patient) as well as two cell lines. The AKT3 E17K mutation results in activation of AKT when expressed in human melanoma cells.

Recent studies performed on LM specimens in the United States of America have identified activating mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene in LM. However, whole tissue but not isolated cell types were studied. Here, we studied LM tissues resected at the University Hospitals Freiburg and Regensburg, Germany. We isolated LECs and fibroblasts separately, and sequenced the commonly affected exons 8, 10, and 21 of the PIK3CA gene. We confirm typical monoallelic mutations in 4 out of 6 LM-derived LEC lines, and describe two new mutations i.) in exon 10 (c.1636C>A; p.Gln546Lys), and ii.) a 3bp in-frame deletion of GAA (Glu109del). LM-derived fibroblasts did not possess such mutations, showing cell-type specificity of the gene defect. High activity of the PIK3CA-AKT- mTOR pathway was demonstrated by hyperphosphorylation of AKT-Ser473 in all LM-derived LECs (including the ones with newly identified mutations), as compared to normal LECs. Additionally, hyperphosphorylation of ERK was seen in all LM-derived LECs, except for the one with Glu109del. In vitro, the small molecule kinase inhibitors Buparlisib/BKM-120, Wortmannin, and Ly294002, (all inhibitors of PIK3CA), CAL-101 (inhibitor of PIK3CD), MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), Sorafenib (multiple kinases inhibitor), and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) significantly blocked proliferation of LM-derived LECs in a concentration-dependent manner, but also blocked proliferation of normal LECs. However, MK-2206 appeared to be more specific for mutated LECs, except in case of Glu109 deletion.

27159400,"IMPORTANCE: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), hemimegalencephaly, and megalencephaly constitute a spectrum of malformations of cortical development with shared neuropathologic features. These disorders are associated with significant childhood morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the underlying molecular cause of FCD, hemimegalencephaly, and diffuse megalencephaly.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with FCD, hemimegalencephaly, or megalencephaly (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 2-32 years) were recruited from Pediatric Hospital A. Meyer, the University of Hong Kong, and Seattle Children's Research Institute from June 2012 to June 2014. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 8 children with FCD or hemimegalencephaly using standard-depth (50-60X) sequencing in peripheral samples (blood, saliva, or skin) from the affected child and their parents and deep (150-180X) sequencing in affected brain tissue. Targeted sequencing and WES were used to screen 93 children with molecularly unexplained diffuse or focal brain overgrowth. Histopathologic and functional assays of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (serine/threonine kinase)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activity in resected brain tissue and cultured neurons were performed to validate mutations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing identified variants associated with this spectrum of developmental brain disorders.
RESULTS: Low-level mosaic mutations of MTOR were identified in brain tissue in 4 children with FCD type 2a with alternative allele fractions ranging from 0.012 to 0.086. Intermediate-level mosaic mutation of MTOR (p.Thr1977Ile) was also identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and pigmentary mosaicism in skin. Finally, a constitutional de novo mutation of MTOR (p.Glu1799Lys) was identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and intellectual disability. Molecular and functional analysis in 2 children with FCD2a from whom multiple affected brain tissue samples were available revealed a mutation gradient with an epicenter in the most epileptogenic area. When expressed in cultured neurons, all MTOR mutations identified here drive constitutive activation of mTOR complex 1 and enlarged neuronal size.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, mutations of MTOR were associated with a spectrum of brain overgrowth phenotypes extending from FCD type 2a to diffuse megalencephaly, distinguished by different mutations and levels of mosaicism. These mutations may be sufficient to cause cellular hypertrophy in cultured neurons and may provide a demonstration of the pattern of mosaicism in brain and substantiate the link between mosaic mutations of MTOR and pigmentary mosaicism in skin.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures.

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation.

Here we describe a mutation assessment pipeline enabled by high-throughput engineering of molecularly barcoded gene variant expression clones identified by tumor sequencing. We first used this platform to functionally assess tail mutations observed in PIK3CA, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) frequently mutated in cancer. Orthogonal screening for PIK3CA variant activity using in vitro and in vivo cell growth and transformation assays differentiated driver from passenger mutations, revealing that PIK3CA variant activity correlates imperfectly with its mutation frequency across breast cancer populations. Although PIK3CA mutations with frequencies above 5% were significantly more oncogenic than wild-type in all assays, mutations occurring at 0.07% to 5.0% included those with and without oncogenic activities that ranged from weak to strong in at least one assay. Proteomic profiling coupled with therapeutic sensitivity assays on PIK3CA variant-expressing cell models revealed variant-specific activation of PI3K signaling as well as other pathways that include the MEK1/2 module of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

We identified compounds that inhibit the leucine-dependent mTORC1 pathway by specifically inhibiting the GTPase activating function of LRS, while not affecting the catalytic activity. For further analysis, we selected one compound, BC-LI-0186, which binds to the RagD interacting site of LRS, thereby inhibiting lysosomal localization of LRS and mTORC1 activity. It also effectively suppressed the activity of cancer-associated MTOR mutants and the growth of rapamycin-resistant cancer cells.

29937275,"Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs), including focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME), are major etiologies of pediatric intractable epilepsies exhibiting cortical dyslamination. Brain somatic mutations in MTOR have recently been identified as a major genetic cause of FMCDs. However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to cortical dyslamination remains poorly understood. Here, using patient tissue, genome-edited cells, and mouse models with brain somatic mutations in MTOR, we discovered that disruption of neuronal ciliogenesis by the mutations underlies cortical dyslamination in FMCDs. We found that abnormal accumulation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites due to perturbed autophagy was responsible for the defective neuronal ciliogenesis. Additionally, we found that disrupted neuronal ciliogenesis accounted for cortical dyslamination in FMCDs by compromising Wnt signals essential for neuronal polarization. Altogether, this study describes a molecular mechanism by which brain somatic mutations in MTOR contribute to the pathogenesis of cortical dyslamination in FMCDs.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

10585442,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is an atypical dimeric homeodomain-containing protein that is expressed in liver, intestine, stomach, kidney, and pancreas. Mutations in the HNF1alpha gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). More than 80 different mutations have been identified so far, many of which involve highly conserved amino acid residues among vertebrate HNF1alpha. In the present work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which MODY3 mutations could affect HNF1alpha function. For this purpose, we analyzed the properties of 10 mutants resulting in amino acid substitutions or protein truncation. Some mutants have a reduced protein stability, whereas others are either defective in the DNA binding or impaired in their intrinsic trans-activation potential. Three mutants, characterized by a complete loss of trans-activation, behave as dominant negatives when transfected with the wild-type protein. These data define a clear causative relationship between MODY3 mutations and functional defects in HNF1alpha trans-activation. In addition, our analysis sheds new light on the structure of a homeoprotein playing a key role in pancreatic beta cell function.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

In this study we have examined the in vivo and in vitro effects of a mutation (L107I) outside the DNA binding and dimerization domains in the N terminal part of the HNF1 alpha gene.
METHODS: Beta-cell function of the affected family members was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Functional tests were carried out to explain the role of the mutation in vitro by transcriptional activity assay, Western blotting, DNA-binding assays and subcellular localization experiments.
RESULTS: Affected family members showed an 86% decreased insulin response to glucose when compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. In vitro the mutation showed a 79% decrease in transcriptional activity as compared to wild type HNF1 alpha in HeLa cells lacking HNF1 alpha. The transcriptional activity was not suppressed when the mutant was co-expressed with wild type HNF1 alpha suggesting that the decreased activity was not mediated by a dominant negative mechanism. The L107I/HNF1alpha protein showed normal nuclear targeting but impaired binding to an HNF1 alpha consensus sequence.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the L107I substitution represents a MODY3 mutation which impairs beta-cell function by a loss-of-function mechanism.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

METHODS: We screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in 50 unrelated southern Chinese families, which fulfilled the minimum criteria for MODY. Functional properties of the mutant proteins were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: Five of the 50 (10%) families were found to have mutations in the coding region, including a new nonsense mutation Q176X and four reported mutations (frameshift mutation P379fsdelCT, nonsense mutation R171X, missense mutations G20R and P112L). These mutations had decreased trans-activating activity on the human insulin gene promoter. We also detected a new intronic sequence variation IVS7nt-6 G-->A, which co-segregated with diabetes. The intronic variation creates a potential splice acceptor site and might alter the splicing of the HNF-1 alpha mRNA.

A correct diagnosis matters as it informs on treatment, progression, and family risk. We describe a multi-dimensional functional dataset of 73 HNF1A missense variants identified in exomes of 12,940 individuals. Our aim was to develop an analytical framework for stratifying variants along the HNF1A phenotypic continuum to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. HNF1A variant function was determined by four different molecular assays. Structure of the multi-dimensional dataset was explored using principal component analysis, k-means, and hierarchical clustering. Weights for tissue-specific isoform expression and functional domain were integrated. Functionally annotated variant subgroups were used to re-evaluate genetic diagnoses in national MODY diagnostic registries. HNF1A variants demonstrated a range of behaviors across the assays. The structure of the multi-parametric data was shaped primarily by transactivation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we obtained high-resolution functional clusters of the variants that separated known causal MODY variants from benign and type 2 diabetes risk variants and led to reclassification of 4% and 9% of HNF1A variants identified in the UK and Norway MODY diagnostic registries, respectively. Our proof-of-principle analyses facilitated informative stratification of HNF1A variants along the continuum, allowing improved evaluation of clinical significance, management, and precision medicine in diabetes clinics.

This ND6 np 14459 mutation changes a moderately conserved alanine to a valine at amino acid position 72 of the ND6 protein. Enzymologic analysis of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) with submitochondrial particles isolated from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts revealed a 60% reduction (P < 0.005) of complex I-specific activity in patient cell lines compared with controls, with no differences in enzymatic activity for complexes II plus III, III and IV. This biochemical defect was assigned to the ND6 np 14459 mutation by using transmitochondrial cybrids in which patient Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblast cell lines were enucleated and the cytoplasts were fused to a mtDNA-deficient (p 0) lymphoblastoid recipient cell line. Cybrids harboring the np 14459 mutation exhibited a 39% reduction (p < 0.02) in complex I-specific activity relative to wild-type cybrid lines but normal activity for the other complexes. Kinetic analysis of the np 14459 mutant complex I revealed that the Vmax of the enzyme was reduced while the Km remained the same as that of wild type. Furthermore, specific activity was inhibited by increasing concentrations of the reduced coenzyme Q analog decylubiquinol.

The transfer of the defect correlated with marked deficiencies in respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity of the transformants and the presence in their mitochondria of mtDNA carrying a tRNA(Lys) mutation. Furthermore, apparently complete segregation of the defective genotype and phenotype was observed in the transformants derived from the heterogeneous proband myoblast population, suggesting that the mtDNA heteroplasmy in this population was to a large extent intercellular.

Both mutations resulted in the same biochemical and molecular genetic phenotypes. Specifically, cybrids containing 100% mutated mtDNAs, but not those containing the corresponding wild-type mtDNAs, exhibited severe defects in respiratory chain activity, in the rates of protein synthesis, and in the steady-state levels of mitochondrial translation products. In addition, aberrant mitochondrial translation products were detected with both mutations. No significant alterations were observed in the processing of polycistronic RNA precursor transcripts derived from the region containing the tRNA(Lys) gene. These results demonstrate that two different mtDNA mutations in tRNA(Lys), both associated with the same mitochondrial disorder, result in fundamentally identical defects at the cellular level and strongly suggest that specific protein synthesis abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We performed a molecular genetic study on a Japanese boy with childhood-onset GSDII. The patient was a compound heterozygote for a newly discovered splice-site c.546G>T mutation and a recurrent missense p.R600C mutation, which usually causes the fatal infantile form in a homozygous state. The c.546G>T mutation, which did not alter the amino-acid sequence, was positioned at the last base of exon 2. cDNA-sequencing analysis revealed that c.546G>T was a leaky splice mutation, leading to the production of a normally spliced transcript, which was responsible for the low-level (approximately 10%) expression of the active enzyme in the patient's fibroblasts.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Here, we inhibited mRNA degradation using cycloheximide and performed unbiased splicing analysis of all GAA exons using exon flanking RT-PCR and exon internal RT-qPCR. In four patients that were suspected of harboring splicing variants but for which aberrant splicing could not be detected in normally growing cells, we detected a total of 10 novel splicing events in cells treated with cycloheximide. In addition, we found that sequences of GAA introns 6 and 12 were naturally included in a subset of transcripts from patients and healthy controls, indicating inefficient canonical splicing. Identification of aberrant splicing caused by the common Asian variant c.546G>T allowed the development of an antisense oligonucleotide that promoted canonical GAA pre-mRNA splicing and elevated GAA enzymatic activity.

Here, the functional significance of 28 MBD missense mutations identified in patients were analysed by transient expression of the mutant proteins in cultured cells. The effects of mutations were evaluated by analysis of the affinity of MeCP2 to pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse L929 cells and on transcriptional repressive activity of MeCP2 in Drosophila SL2 cells. These analyses showed that approximately one-third (9/28) of MBD missense mutations showed strong impairment of MeCP2 function. The mutation of the R111 residue, which directly interacts with the methyl group of methyl cytosine, completely abolished MeCP2 function and mutations affecting beta-sheets and a hairpin loop have substantial functional consequences. In contrast, mutations that showed marginal or mild impairment of the function fell in unstructured regions with no DNA interaction.

To validate our approach, we have ectopically targeted MeCP2 chromatin binding deficient Rett mutants to constitutive heterochromatic regions and analyze its functional consequences. We could show that, once bound to their endogenous target regions, their ability to re-organize higher order chromatin structure is restored. Furthermore, a temporally controlled targeting strategy allowed us to monitor MeCP2-mediated chromatin rearrangements in vivo and to visualize large-scale chromatin movements over several micrometers, as well as heterochromatic foci fusion events.

To define the molecular mechanism underlying MODY3 we investigated the functional properties of seven MODY3-associated mutations representing the spectrum of different kinds of mutations affecting all functional domains of the protein. The mutations introduced into an expression vector encoding human HNF1alpha include in-frame deletion (AN127), nonsense (Q7X, R171X), frameshift (P291fsinsC) and missense (R229Q, P447L, T6201) mutations. Gel retardation and reporter gene assays showed that the functional properties of these mutants differ dramatically, but none of these mutants act in a dominant negative manner. Moreover, the mRNA stability of the mutants AN127, R171X, P291fsinsC and T547E548fsdelTG is impaired compared to the wild-type sequence in transfected cells.

This deletion results in a RyR1 protein lacking the last 202 amino acid residues. All three subjects heterozygotic for the mutated allele presented with a prevalence of type 1 fibres with central cores, although none experienced clinical signs of myopathy.

Expression of wild-type and RyR1(R4836fsX4838) proteins resulted in heterozygotic release channels with overall functional properties similar to those of wild-type RyR1 channels. Nevertheless, small differences in sensitivity to calcium and caffeine were observed in heterotetrameric channels, which also presented an altered assembly/stability in sucrose-gradient centrifugation analysis.

Missense variants in the ryanodine receptor 1 gene ( RYR1 ) are associated with malignant hyperthermia but only a minority of these have met the criteria for use in predictive DNA diagnosis. We examined the utility of a simplified method of segregation analysis and a functional assay for determining the pathogenicity of recurrent RYR1 variants associated with malignant hyperthermia.
METHODS: . We identified previously uncharacterised RYR1 variants found in four or more malignant hyperthermia families and conducted simplified segregation analyses. An efficient cloning and mutagenesis strategy was used to express ryanodine receptor protein containing one of six RYR1 variants in HEK293 cells. Caffeine-induced calcium release, measured using a fluorescent calcium indicator, was compared in cells expressing each variant to that in cells expressing wild type ryanodine receptor protein.
RESULTS.: We identified 43 malignant hyperthermia families carrying one of the six RYR1 variants. There was segregation of genotype with the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility phenotype in families carrying the p.E3104K and p.D3986E variants, but the number of informative meioses limited the statistical significance of the associations. HEK293 functional assays demonstrated an increased sensitivity of RyR1 channels containing the p.R2336H, p.R2355W, p.E3104K, p.G3990V and p.V4849I compared with wild type, but cells expressing p.D3986E had a similar caffeine sensitivity to cells expressing wild type RyR1.

METHODS: We initially included one individual from each positive family tested in the UK MH Unit since 1971 to detect variants in RYR1, CACNA1S, or STAC3. Screening for genetic variants has been ongoing since 1991 and has involved a range of techniques, most recently next generation sequencing. We assessed the pathogenicity of variants using standard guidelines, including family segregation studies. The prevalence of recurrent variants of unknown significance was compared with the prevalence reported in a large database of sequence variants in low-risk populations.
RESULTS: We have confirmed MH susceptibility in 795 independent families, for 722 of which we have a DNA sample. Potentially pathogenic variants were found in 555 families, with 25 RYR1 and one CACNA1S variants previously unclassified recurrent variants significantly over-represented (P&lt;1×10-7) in our cohort compared with the Exome Aggregation Consortium database.

Although some MHRyR1s have been shown to enhance sensitivity to caffeine and halothane when expressed in non-muscle cells, their influence on EC coupling can only be studied in skeletal myotubes. We therefore expressed WTRyR1, six of the most common human MHRyR1s (R163C, G341R, R614C, R2163C, V2168M, and R2458H), and a newly identified C-terminal mutation (T4826I) in dyspedic myotubes to study their functional defects and how they influence EC coupling. Myotubes expressing any MHRyR1 were significantly more sensitive to stimulation by caffeine and 4-CmC than those expressing WTRyR1. The hypersensitivity of MH myotubes extended to K+ depolarization. MH myotubes responded to direct channel activators with maximum Ca2+ amplitudes consistently smaller than WT myotubes, whereas the amplitude of their responses to depolarization were consistently larger than WT myotubes. The magnitudes of responses attainable from myotubes expressing MHRyR1s are therefore related to the nature of the stimulus rather than size of the Ca2+ store. The functional changes of MHRyR1s were directly analyzed using [3H]ryanodine binding analysis of isolated myotube membranes. Although none of the MHRyR1s examined significantly altered EC50 for Ca2+ activation, many failed to be completely inhibited by a low Ca2+ (<or=100 nm), and all were significantly more responsive to caffeine than WTRyR1 at Ca2+ concentrations that approximate those in resting myotubes. All seven mutations had diminished sensitivity to inhibition by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Using a homologous expression system, our study demonstrates for the first time that these 7 MH mutations are all both necessary and sufficient to induce MH-related phenotypes. Decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ and Mg2+ inhibition and inability of MHRyR1s to be fully inactivated at [Ca2+]i typical of normal myotubes at rest are key defects that contribute to the initiation of MH episodes.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Denaturing and nondenaturing electrophoresis showed myocilin to be a secreted protein with the tendency to self-oligomerize. The full-length myocilin and its C-terminal cleavage fragment are secreted. Secretion analysis of 23 variant myocilins indicated that secretion defects are closely related to the pathogenicity of MYOC variants. Structural analysis showed that the alteration of steric clash is associated with the secretion characteristics and pathogenicity of myocilin variants. Immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that mutated myocilins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and disrupt autophagy. MTT assay, MitoTracker staining, and DCFH-DA staining showed increased oxidative injury in cells expressing MYOC mutants.

We hypothesize that, like in other diseases of protein misfolding, aggregation and downstream pathogenesis originate from the compromised thermal stability of mutant myocilins. In an expansion of our pilot study of four mutants, we compare 21 additional purified OLF variants by using a fluorescence stability assay and investigate the secondary structure of the most stable variants by circular dichroism. Variants with lower melting temperatures are correlated with earlier glaucoma diagnoses. The chemical chaperone trimethylamine N-oxide is capable of restoring the stability of most, but not all, variants to wild-type (WT) levels. Interestingly, three reported OLF disease variants, A427T, G246R, and A445V, exhibited properties indistinguishable from those of WT OLF, but an increased apparent aggregation propensity in vitro relative to that of WT OLF suggests that biophysical factors other than thermal stability, such as kinetics and unfolding pathways, may also be involved in myocilin glaucoma pathogenesis. Similarly, no changes from WT OLF stability and secondary structure were detected for three annotated single-nucleotide polymorphism variants.

Because calcium ions are important biological cofactors that play numerous roles in extracellular matrix proteins, we examined the calcium binding properties of the myocilin OLF domain (myoc-OLF). Our study reveals an unprecedented high affinity calcium binding site within myoc-OLF. The calcium ion remains bound to wild-type OLF at neutral and acidic pH. A glaucoma-causing OLF variant, myoc-OLF(D380A), is calcium-depleted. Key differences in secondary and tertiary structure between myoc-OLF(D380A) and wild-type myoc-OLF, as well as limited access to chelators, indicate that the calcium binding site is largely buried in the interior of the protein. Analysis of six conserved aspartate or glutamate residues and an additional 18 disease-causing variants revealed two other candidate residues that may be involved in calcium coordination.

Herein, we generated a Gaussia luciferase-based MYOC fusion protein to quickly and sensitively track the secretion of MYOC variants and compared these results to the better-established western blotting assay for MYOC.
METHODS: Fourteen clinically-derived MYOC variants with varying degrees of predicted pathogenicity were transfected into HEK-293A cells and analyzed by either a luciferase assay or western blotting.
RESULTS: Eight of the variants (G12R, V53A, T204T, P254L, T325T, D380H, D395_E396insDP, and P481S) had not been biochemically assessed previously. Of these, P254L and D395_E396insDP demonstrated significant secretion defects reminiscent of glaucoma-causing mutations. The luciferase assay results agreed with western blotting for thirteen of the fourteen variants (93%), suggesting a strong concordance.

It has been hypothesized that ATM missense mutations are implicated in breast cancer, and there is some evidence to support this. The presence of a large variety of rare missense variants in addition to common polymorphisms in ATM makes it difficult to establish such a relationship by association studies. To investigate the functional significance of these changes we have introduced missense substitutions, identified in either A-T or breast cancer patients, into ATM cDNA before establishing stable cell lines to determine their effect on ATM function. Pathogenic missense mutations and neutral missense variants were distinguished initially by their capacity to correct the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. Furthermore missense mutations abolished the radiation-induced kinase activity of ATM in normal control cells, caused chromosome instability, and reduced cell viability in irradiated control cells, whereas neutral variants failed to do so. Mutant ATM was expressed at the same level as endogenous protein, and interference with normal ATM function seemed to be by multimerization. This approach represents a means of identifying genuine ATM mutations and addressing the significance of missense changes in the ATM gene in a variety of cancers including breast cancer.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
18634022,"The functional consequences of missense variants are often difficult to predict. This becomes especially relevant when DNA sequence changes are used to determine a diagnosis or prognosis. To analyze the consequences of 12 missense variants in patients with mild forms of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), we employed site-directed mutagenesis of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) cDNA followed by stable transfections into a single A-T cell line to isolate the effects of each allele on the cellular phenotype. After induction of the transfected cells with CdCl2, we monitored for successful ATM transcription and subsequently assessed: 1) intracellular ATM protein levels; 2) ionizing radiation (IR)-induced ATM kinase activity; and 3) cellular radiosensitivity. We then calculated SIFT and PolyPhen scores for the missense changes. Nine variants produced little or no correction of the A-T cellular phenotype and were interpreted to be ATM mutations; SIFT/PolyPhen scores supported this. Three variants corrected the cellular phenotype, suggesting that they represented benign variants or polymorphisms. SIFT and PolyPhen scores supported the functional analyses for one of these variants (c.1709T>C); the other two were predicted to be ""not tolerated"" (c.6188G>A and c.6325T>G) and were classified as ""operationally neutral."" Genotype/phenotype relationships were compared: three deleterious missense variants were associated with an increased risk of cancer (c.6679C>T, c.7271T>G, and c.8494C>T). In situ mutagenesis represents an effective experimental approach for distinguishing deleterious missense mutations from benign or operationally neutral missense variants.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
31181185,"Dozens of pathogenic mutations have been localized in the mitochondrial gene (MT-ATP6) that encodes the subunit a of ATP synthase. The subunit a together with a ring of identical subunits c moves protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane coupled to rotation of the subunit c-ring and ATP synthesis. One of these mutations, m.8851T&gt;C, has been associated with bilateral striatal lesions of childhood (BSLC), a group of rare neurological disorders characterized by symmetric degeneration of the corpus striatum. It converts a highly conserved tryptophan residue into arginine at position 109 of subunit a (aW<sub>109</sub>R). We previously showed that an equivalent thereof in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (aW<sub>126</sub>R) severely impairs by an unknown mechanism the functioning of ATP synthase without any visible assembly/stability defect. Herein we show that ATP synthase function was recovered to varying degree by replacing the mutant arginine residue 126 with methionine, lysine or glycine or by replacing with methionine an arginine residue present at position 169 of subunit a (aR<sub>169</sub>). In recently described atomic structures of yeast ATP synthase, aR<sub>169</sub> is at the center of a hydrophilic cleft along which protons are transported from the subunit c-ring to the mitochondrial matrix, in the proximity of the two residues known from a long time to be essential to the activity of F<sub>O</sub> (aR<sub>176</sub> and cE<sub>59</sub>). We provide evidence that the aW<sub>126</sub>R change is responsible for electrostatic and steric hindrance that enables aR<sub>169</sub> to engage in a salt bridge with cE<sub>59</sub>. As a result, aR<sub>176</sub> cannot interact properly with cE<sub>5</sub> and ATP synthase fails to effectively move protons across the mitochondrial membrane. In addition to insight into the pathogenic mechanism induced by the m.8851T&gt;C mutation, the present study brings interesting information about the role of specific residues of subunit a in the energy-transducing activity of ATP synthase.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

We examined two aspects of myotube physiology, namely excitation-contraction and excitation-secretion coupling. Our results show that upon activation of the ryanodine receptor (RYR), myotubes release interleukin-6 (IL-6); this was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and could be blocked by dantrolene and cyclosporine. Myotubes from the two patients affected by central core disease showed a 4-fold increase in the release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, compared with cells derived from control or malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals. All tested myotubes released calcium from intracellular stores upon stimulation via surface membrane depolarization or direct RYR activation by 4-chloro-m-cresol. The functional impact on calcium release of RYR1 mutations linked to central core disease or malignant hyperthermia is different: human myotubes carrying the malignant hyperthermia-linked RYR1 mutation V2168M had a shift in their sensitivity to the RYR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol to lower concentrations, whereas human myotubes harboring C-terminal mutations linked to central core disease exhibited reduced [Ca2+]i increase in response to 4-chloro-m-cresol, caffeine, and KCl. Taken together, these results suggest that abnormal release of calcium via mutated RYR enhances the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which may in turn affect signaling pathways responsible for the trophic status of muscle fibers.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

27229139,"Bookmarking factors are transcriptional regulators involved in the mitotic transmission of epigenetic information via their ability to remain associated with mitotic chromatin. The mechanisms through which bookmarking factors bind to mitotic chromatin remain poorly understood. HNF1β is a bookmarking transcription factor that is frequently mutated in patients suffering from renal multicystic dysplasia and diabetes. Here, we show that HNF1β bookmarking activity is impaired by naturally occurring mutations found in patients. Interestingly, this defect in HNF1β mitotic chromatin association is rescued by an abrupt decrease in temperature. The rapid relocalization to mitotic chromatin is reversible and driven by a specific switch in DNA-binding ability of HNF1β mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that importin-β is involved in the maintenance of the mitotic retention of HNF1β, suggesting a functional link between the nuclear import system and the mitotic localization/translocation of bookmarking factors. Altogether, our studies have disclosed novel aspects on the mechanisms and the genetic programs that account for the mitotic association of HNF1β, a bookmarking factor that plays crucial roles in the epigenetic transmission of information through the cell cycle.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We studied the biological characteristics of the mutation and the potential functional consequences based on the crystallographic structure of HNF-1alpha in complex with DNA.
METHODS: DNA from subjects with a familial form of early onset diabetes was isolated and HNF-1alpha was sequenced. The R263L substitution was generated by PCR-based sited-directed mutagenesis. Functional and biochemical studies were conducted by reporter assay using glucose-transporter type 2 (GLUT2) or insulin promoters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively.
RESULTS: Transfection of wild-type HNF-1alpha increased the reporter activities of GLUT2 and insulin promoters in NIH3T3 and SK-Hep1 cells, while R263L mutant was defective in transactivation of those promoters. Both wild-type HNF-1alpha and R263L mutant could not transactivate GLUT2 and insulin promoters in MIN6N8 insulinoma cells. R263L mutant had a defective cooperation with its heterodimeric partner HNF-1beta or coactivator p300. R263L mutant protein displayed greatly reduced DNA binding ability, despite its comparable protein stability to the wild-type HNF-1alpha.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the mutation of HNF-1alpha at codon 263 from arginine to leucine leads to the development of MODY3 through decreased insulin production and defective glucose sensing. These findings are in good agreement with the crystal structure in which R263 makes hydrogen bonds with phosphorus atoms of DNA backbone to mediate the stable binding of HNF-1alpha homeodomain to the promoter.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding HNF-1α (HNF1A) cause familial young-onset diabetes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (MODY3). The variability of the MODY3 clinical phenotype can be due to environmental and genetic factors as well as to the type and position of mutations. Thus, functional characterization of HNF1A mutations might provide insight into the molecular defects explaining the variability of the MODY3 phenotype.

Target DNA binding affinities have been quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-HNF-1α fusion proteins and nuclear extracts of transfected Cos7 cells. Our functional studies revealed that mutation c-57-64delCACGCGGT;c-55G>C reduces HNF1A promoter activity in Min6 cells and that missense mutations have variable effects. Mutation p.Arg271Trp impairs HNF-1α activity in all conditions tested, whereas mutations p.Val133Met, p.Glu235Gly and p.Pro379Arg exert differential effects depending on the target promoter.

To address this question, we first analyzed fourteen disease-causing amino acid changes using the recently described crystal structure of VLCAD. The predicted effects varied from the replacement of amino acid residues lining the substrate binding cavity, involved in holoenzyme-FAD interactions or in enzyme dimerisation, predicted to have severe functional consequences, up to amino acid substitutions outside key enzyme domains or lying on near enzyme surface, with predicted milder consequences. These data were combined with functional analysis of residual fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and VLCAD protein levels in patient cells harboring these mutations, before and after pharmacological stimulation by bezafibrate. Mutations identified as detrimental to the protein structure in the 3-D model were generally associated to profound FAO and VLCAD protein deficiencies in the patient cells, however, some mutations affecting FAD binding or monomer-monomer interactions allowed a partial response to bezafibrate. On the other hand, bezafibrate restored near-normal FAO rates in some mutations predicted to have milder consequences on enzyme structure.

This presents a diagnostic challenge, especially in the setting of late-onset Pompe disease when symptoms are rarely apparent at birth. There is an unmet need for validated functional studies to aid in classification of GAA variants. Methods: We developed an in vitro mammalian cell expression and functional analysis system based on guidelines established by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group for PS3/BS3. We validated the assay with 12 control variants and subsequently analyzed eight VUS or novel variants in GAA identified in patients with a positive newborn screen for Pompe disease without phenotypic evidence of infantile-onset disease. Results: The control variants were analyzed in our expression system and an activity range was established. The pathogenic controls had GAA activity between 0% and 11% of normal. The benign or likely benign controls had an activity range of 54%-100%. The pseudodeficiency variant had activity of 17%. These ranges were then applied to the variants selected for functional studies. Using the threshold of &lt;11%, we were able to apply PS3_ supporting to classify two variants as likely pathogenic (c.316C &gt; T and c.1103G &gt; A) and provide further evidence to support the classification of likely pathogenic for two variants (c.1721T &gt; C and c.1048G &gt; A). One variant (c.1123C &gt; T) was able to be reclassified based on other supporting evidence. We were unable to reclassify three variants (c.664G &gt; A, c.2450A &gt; G, and c.1378G &gt; A) due to insufficient or conflicting evidence. Conclusion: We investigated eight GAA variants as proof of concept using our validated and reproducible in vitro expression and functional analysis system.

Myocilin forms part of the trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix presumed to regulate intraocular pressure. Missense mutations, clustered in the olfactomedin (OLF) domain of myocilin, render the protein prone to aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum of trabecular meshwork cells, causing cell dysfunction and death. Cellular studies have demonstrated temperature-sensitive secretion of myocilin mutants, but difficulties in expression and purification have precluded biophysical characterization of wild-type (wt) myocilin and disease-causing mutants in vitro. We have overcome these limitations by purifying wt and select glaucoma-causing mutant (D380A, I477N, I477S, K423E) forms of the OLF domain (228-504) fused to a maltose binding protein (MBP) from E. coli . Monomeric fusion proteins can be isolated in solution. To determine the relative stability of wt and mutant OLF domains, we developed a fluorescence thermal stability assay without removal of MBP and provide the first direct evidence that mutated OLF is folded but less thermally stable than wt. We tested the ability of seven chemical chaperones to stabilize mutant myocilin. Only sarcosine and trimethylamine N-oxide were capable of shifting the melting temperature of all mutants tested to near that of wt OLF.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic defects in a GT patient.
METHODS: The expression of alphaIIbbeta3 was determined by flow cytometric analysis and Western blotting. We analyzed the cDNA sequences of both alphaIIb and beta3, and performed transfection experiments using COS7 cells to confirm that a specific mutation was responsible for the GT case.
RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis and Western blotting showed remarkably reduced expression of alphaIIbbeta3. Sequence analysis of the patient's cDNA indicated a new missense mutation that led to the amino acid substitution of Ile304 (ATC) with Asn (AAC) in exon 6 of the beta3 gene. This was in addition to the missense mutation of His280 (CAT) to Pro (CCT) in exon 5, which had been previously reported. The missense mutation of Ile304 (ATC) to Asn (AAC) in beta3 was found to be responsible for this GT case. This was because transfection experiments using COS7 cells indicated that alphaIIbbeta3 possessing Asn304 in beta3 was not expressed on the surface of the transfected cells. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that alphaIIbbeta3 was absent inside the transfected COS7 cells possessing Asn304 in beta(3).

20056103,"Several human neurological disorders have been associated with various mutations affecting mitochondrial enzymes involved in cellular ATP production. One of these mutations, T9176C in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), changes a highly conserved leucine residue into proline at position 217 of the mitochondrially encoded Atp6p (or a) subunit of the F1FO-ATP synthase. The consequences of this mutation on the mitochondrial ATP synthase are still poorly defined. To gain insight into the primary pathogenic mechanisms induced by T9176C, we have investigated the consequences of this mutation on the ATP synthase of yeast where Atp6p is also encoded by the mtDNA. In vitro, yeast atp6-T9176C mitochondria showed a 30% decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis. When forcing the F1FO complex to work in the reverse mode, i.e. F1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP coupled to proton transport out of the mitochondrial matrix, the mutant showed a normal proton-pumping activity and this activity was fully sensitive to oligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase proton channel. However, under conditions of maximal ATP hydrolytic activity, using non-osmotically protected mitochondria, the mutant ATPase activity was less efficiently inhibited by oligomycin (60% inhibition versus 85% for the wild type control). Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis analyses revealed that atp6-T9176C yeast accumulated rather good levels of fully assembled ATP synthase complexes. However, a number of sub-complexes (F1, Atp9p-ring, unassembled alpha-F1 subunits) could be detected as well, presumably because of a decreased stability of Atp6p within the ATP synthase. Although the oxidative phosphorylation capacity was reduced in atp6-T9176C yeast, the number of ATP molecules synthesized per electron transferred to oxygen was similar compared with wild type yeast. It can therefore be inferred that the coupling efficiency within the ATP synthase was mostly unaffected and that the T9176C mutation did not increase the proton permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

These results provide valuable hints about processes misregulated in patients heterozygous for these mutations, to be re-addressed more stringently in patient iPSC-derivative neuro-organoids.

Careful evaluation of renal biopsy samples revealed a decreased staining of cells induced by COX and NADH dehydrogenase activities, and a strong fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. These anomalies were due to the presence of a mutation in the mitochondrial ATP6 gene, G8969>A. This mutation leads to replacement of a highly conserved serine residue at position 148 of the a-subunit of ATP synthase. Increasing the mutation load in cybrid cell lines was paralleled by the appearance of abnormal mitochondrial morphologies, diminished respiration and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. An equivalent of the G8969>A mutation in yeast had dramatic consequences on ATP synthase, with a block in proton translocation. The mutation was particularly abundant (89%) in the kidney compared to blood and urine, which is likely the reason why this organ was affected first.

2760205,"This paper describes an unusual kindred with familial hypercholesterolemia in which one-third of the relatives with a mutant LDL receptor gene have normal plasma cholesterol concentrations. The proband, a 9-yr-old boy with a plasma cholesterol value greater than 500 mg/dl, is homozygous for a point mutation that changes Ser156 to Leu in the LDL receptor. This substitution in the fourth repeat of the ligand binding domain slows the transport of the protein to the cell surface. The defective receptor cannot bind LDL, which contains apo B-100, but it does bind beta-migrating VLDL, which contains apo E in addition to apo B-100. Although the mother is heterozygous for this mutation, her LDL-cholesterol concentration is consistently in the 28th percentile for the population. Through direct examination of genomic DNA, we identified the mutant gene in heterozygous form in 17 of the mother's relatives, five of whom had normal LDL-cholesterol values. The pedigree was consistent with dominant transmission of a single gene that ameliorates or suppresses the hypercholesterolemic effect of the LDL receptor mutation. Through linkage analysis, we excluded the possibility that this suppressor gene was an allele at the LDL receptor locus. We also excluded the genes for the two ligands for the LDL receptor, apo B-100 and apo E. The existence of this putative suppressor gene may explain the occasional observation of normal LDL-cholesterol concentrations in heterozygotes for LDL receptor mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
28862265,"Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney is a rare tumor (≤25 reported cases) characterized by the presence of cysts, and solid areas composed of bundles of undifferentiated spindle cells, showing marked cellular anaplasia (usually accompanied by TP53 overexpression). These tumors often feature prominent areas of cartilage or chondroid material. Germline mutations in DICER1, encoding the microRNA (miRNA) processor DICER1, cause an eponymous syndrome. Recent reports suggest that anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney should be included in DICER1 syndrome as germline DICER1 mutations are associated with the occurrence of such tumors. Therefore, we sought to determine the following: (1) what proportion of anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney have DICER1 mutations; (2) whether the identified mutations affect both alleles of DICER1 (ie, are biallelic); (3) whether somatic missense mutations in the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain impact miRNA generation; and (4) whether TP53 alteration always occurs in these tumors. DICER1 mutations were evaluated by Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing in nine tumor/normal pairs. Impact of DICER1 mutations on miRNA generation was evaluated via an in vitro DICER1 cleavage assay. TP53 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Eight of the nine cases had at least one RNase IIIb DICER1 mutation that impacted the generation of miRNAs. There were six tumors with truncating DICER1 mutations and in four of them, the mutation found in the tumor was also detected in adjacent normal tissue, and therefore was likely to be either mosaic or germline in origin. Analysis of mutation phase revealed that two of three tumors had biallelic DICER1 mutations. Six of nine anaplastic sarcomas of the kidney had aberrant TP53 immunohistochemisty with damaging TP53 mutations identified in three cases. Taken together, these data suggest that the great majority of anaplastic sarcomas of the kidney have DICER1 mutations and confirm that these tumors are part of the DICER1 syndrome.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
37333613,"The endoribonuclease DICER1 plays an essential role in the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway, cleaving precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) stem-loops to generate mature single-stranded miRNAs. Germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in DICER1 result in DICER1 tumor predisposition syndrome (DTPS), a mainly childhood-onset tumor susceptibility disorder. Most DTPS-causing GPVs are nonsense or frameshifting, with tumor development requiring a second somatic missense hit that impairs the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain. Interestingly, germline DICER1 missense variants that cluster in the DICER1 Platform domain have been identified in some persons affected by tumors that also associate with DTPS. Here, we demonstrate that four of these Platform domain variants prevent DICER1 from producing mature miRNAs and as a result impair miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Importantly, we show that in contrast to canonical somatic missense variants that alter DICER1 cleavage activity, DICER1 proteins harboring these Platform variants fail to bind to pre-miRNA stem-loops. Taken together, this work sheds light upon a unique subset of GPVs causing DTPS and provides new insights into how alterations in the DICER1 Platform domain can impact miRNA biogenesis.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
34257294,"Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a Ca2+ release channel in skeletal muscle, hyperactivate the channel to cause malignant hyperthermia (MH) and are implicated in severe heat stroke. Dantrolene, the only approved drug for MH, has the disadvantages of having very poor water solubility and long plasma half-life. We show here that an oxolinic acid-derivative RyR1-selective inhibitor, 6,7-(methylenedioxy)-1-octyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid (Compound 1, Cpd1), effectively prevents and treats MH and heat stroke in several mouse models relevant to MH. Cpd1 reduces resting intracellular Ca2+, inhibits halothane- and isoflurane-induced Ca2+ release, suppresses caffeine-induced contracture in skeletal muscle, reduces sarcolemmal cation influx, and prevents or reverses the fulminant MH crisis induced by isoflurane anesthesia and rescues animals from heat stroke caused by environmental heat stress. Notably, Cpd1 has great advantages of better water solubility and rapid clearance in vivo over dantrolene. Cpd1 has the potential to be a promising candidate for effective treatment of patients carrying RyR1 mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,0,
28687594,"Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cause malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD), whereas mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) lead to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Most disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations are located in the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of the corresponding ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoform. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release during store Ca2+ overload, a process known as store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Considering the similar locations of disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations in the RyR structure, we hypothesize that like CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations, MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations also enhance SOICR. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact on SOICR of 12 MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations E2347-del, R2163H, G2434R, R2435L, R2435H, and R2454H located in the central region, and Y4796C, T4826I, L4838V, A4940T, G4943V, and P4973L located in the C-terminal region of the channel. We found that all these RyR1 mutations reduced the threshold for SOICR. Dantrolene, an acute treatment for MH, suppressed SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing the RyR1 mutants R164C, Y523S, R2136H, R2435H, and Y4796C. Interestingly, carvedilol, a commonly used β-blocker that suppresses RyR2-mediated SOICR, also inhibits SOICR in these RyR1 mutant HEK293 cells. Therefore, these results indicate that a reduced SOICR threshold is a common defect of MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations, and that carvedilol, like dantrolene, can suppress RyR1-mediated SOICR. Clinical studies of the effectiveness of carvedilol as a long-term treatment for MH/CCD or other RyR1-associated disorders may be warranted.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
22139840,"Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is primarily conferred by mutations within ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1). Here we address how the MHS mutation T4826I within the S4-S5 linker influences excitation-contraction coupling and resting myoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](rest)) in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and vastus lateralis prepared from heterozygous (Het) and homozygous (Hom) T4826I-RYR1 knock-in mice (Yuen, B.

FDB responses to electrical stimuli and acute halothane (0.1%, v/v) exposure showed a rank order of Hom ≫ Het ≫ WT. Release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry contributed to halothane-triggered increases in [Ca(2+)](rest) in Hom FDBs and elicited pronounced Ca(2+) oscillations in ∼30% of FDBs tested. Genotype contributed significantly elevated [Ca(2+)](rest) (Hom > Het > WT) measured in vivo using ion-selective microelectrodes. Het and Hom oxygen consumption rates measured in intact myotubes using the Seahorse Bioscience (Billerica, MA) flux analyzer and mitochondrial content measured with MitoTracker were lower than WT, whereas total cellular calpain activity was higher than WT. Muscle membranes did not differ in RYR1 expression nor in Ser(2844) phosphorylation among the genotypes. Single channel analysis showed highly divergent gating behavior with Hom and WT favoring open and closed states, respectively, whereas Het exhibited heterogeneous gating behaviors. [(3)H]Ryanodine binding analysis revealed a gene dose influence on binding density and regulation by Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and temperature. Pronounced abnormalities inherent in T4826I-RYR1 channels confer MHS and promote basal disturbances of excitation-contraction coupling, [Ca(2+)](rest), and oxygen consumption rates. Considering that both Het and Hom T4826I-RYR1 mice are viable, the remarkable isolated single channel dysfunction mediated through this mutation in S4-S5 cytoplasmic linker must be highly regulated in vivo.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

METHODS: We observed the general phenotype; determined the sensitivity of myotubes to caffeine-, KCl, and halothane-induced Ca2+ release; determined the in vivo response to halothane or increased ambient temperature; and determined the in vivo myoplasmic intracellular Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle before and during exposure to volatile anaesthetics.
RESULTS: RYR1 pG2435R/MH normal (MHS-Heterozygous[Het]) or RYR1 pG2435R/pG2435R (MHS-Homozygous[Hom]) mice were fully viable under typical rearing conditions, although some male MHS-Hom mice died spontaneously. The normalised half-maximal effective concentration (95% confidence interval) for intracellular Ca2+ release in myotubes in response to KCl [MH normal, MHN, 21.4 (19.8-23.1) mM; MHS-Het 16.2 (15.2-17.2) mM; MHS-Hom 11.2 (10.2-12.2) mM] and caffeine (MHN, 5.7 (5-6.3) mM; MHS-Het 4.5 (3.9-5.0) mM; MHS-Hom 1.77 (1.5-2.1) mM] exhibited a gene dose-dependent decrease, and there was a gene dose-dependent increase in halothane sensitivity. Intact animals show a gene dose-dependent susceptibility to MH with volatile anaesthetics or to heat stroke. RYR1 p.G2435R mice had elevated skeletal muscle intracellular resting [Ca2+]<sub>i</sub>, (values are expressed as mean (SD)) (MHN 123 (3) nM; MHS-Het 156 (16) nM; MHS-Hom 265 (32) nM; P&lt;0.001) and [Na+]<sub>i</sub> (MHN 8 (0.1) mM; MHS-Het 10 (1) mM; MHS-Hom 14 (0.7) mM; P&lt;0.001) that was further increased by exposure to volatile anaesthetics.

VLCAD deficiency is clinically heterogenous, with three major phenotypes: a severe childhood form, with early onset, high mortality, and high incidence of cardiomyopathy; a milder childhood form, with later onset, usually with hypoketotic hypoglycemia as the main presenting feature, low mortality, and rare cardiomyopathy; and an adult form, with isolated skeletal muscle involvement, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, usually triggered by exercise or fasting. To examine whether these different phenotypes are due to differences in the VLCAD genotype, we investigated 58 different mutations in 55 unrelated patients representing all known clinical phenotypes and correlated the mutation type with the clinical phenotype. Our results show a clear relationship between the nature of the mutation and the severity of disease. Patients with the severe childhood phenotype have mutations that result in no residual enzyme activity, whereas patients with the milder childhood and adult phenotypes have mutations that may result in residual enzyme activity. This clear genotype-phenotype relationship is in sharp contrast to what has been observed in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, in which no correlation between genotype and phenotype can be established.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

21918424,"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) result in malignant hyperthermia, a pharmacogenetic disorder typically triggered by administration of anesthetics. However, cases of sudden death during exertion, heat challenge, and febrile illness in the absence of triggering drugs have been reported. The underlying causes of such drug-free fatal ""awake"" episodes are unknown.
METHODS: De novo R3983C variant in RYR1 was identified in two unrelated children who experienced fatal, nonanesthetic awake episodes associated with febrile illness and heat stress. One of the children also had a second novel, maternally inherited D4505H variant located on a separate haplotype. Effects of all possible heterotypic expression conditions on RYR1 sensitivity to caffeine-induced Ca release were determined in expressing RYR1-null myotubes.
RESULTS: Compared with wild-type RYR1 alone (EC50 = 2.85 ± 0.49 mM), average (± SEM) caffeine sensitivity of Ca release was modestly increased after coexpression with either R3983C (EC50 = 2.00 ± 0.39 mM) or D4505H (EC50 = 1.64 ± 0.24 mM). Remarkably, coexpression of wild-type RYR1 with the double mutant in cis (R3983C-D4505H) produced a significantly stronger sensitization of caffeine-induced Ca release (EC50 = 0.64 ± 0.17 mM) compared with that observed after coexpression of the two variants on separate subunits (EC50 = 1.53 ± 0.18 mM).
CONCLUSIONS: The R3983C mutation potentiates D4505H-mediated sensitization of caffeine-induced RYR1 Ca release when the mutations are in cis (on the same subunit) but not when present on separate subunits. Nevertheless, coexpression of the two variants on separate subunits still resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in caffeine sensitivity, consistent with the observed awake episodes and heat sensitivity.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
31107960,"Ryanodine receptor type I (RYR1)-related myopathies (RYR1 RM) are a clinically and histopathologically heterogeneous group of conditions that represent the most common subtype of childhood onset non-dystrophic muscle disorders. There are no treatments for this severe group of diseases. A major barrier to therapy development is the lack of an animal model that mirrors the clinical severity of pediatric cases of the disease. To address this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate a novel recessive mouse model of RYR1 RM. This mouse (Ryr1TM/Indel) possesses a patient-relevant point mutation (T4706M) engineered into 1 allele and a 16 base pair frameshift deletion engineered into the second allele. Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit an overt phenotype beginning at 14 days of age that consists of reduced body/muscle mass and myofibre hypotrophy. Ryr1TM/Indel mice become progressively inactive from that point onward and die at a median age of 42 days. Histopathological assessment shows myofibre hypotrophy, increased central nuclei and decreased triad number but no clear evidence of metabolic cores. Biochemical analysis reveals a marked decrease in RYR1 protein levels (20% of normal) as compared to only a 50% decrease in transcript. Functional studies at end stage show significantly reduced electrically evoked Ca2+ release and force production. In summary, Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit a post-natal lethal recessive form of RYR1 RM that pheno-copies the severe congenital clinical presentation seen in a subgroup of RYR1 RM children. Thus, Ryr1TM/Indel mice represent a powerful model for both establishing the pathomechanisms of recessive RYR1 RM and pre-clinical testing of therapies for efficacy.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
1652892,"Infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, results from a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (GAA). Sequencing of the cDNA from a cell line (GM 244) derived from a patient with Pompe disease demonstrated a T953-to-C transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. The basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for NcoI and StyI. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed both a normal and an abnormal NcoI fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. NcoI and StyI digestion of cDNA, amplified by PCR from reverse-transcribed RNA, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the GAA mRNA in GM 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. The missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional GAA-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic DNA with NcoI and hybridization. The amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for N-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. We could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express GAA enzyme activity after transient gene expression. We have therefore now provided the first identification of a single-basepair missense mutation in a patient with Pompe disease and furthermore have demonstrated that the patient is a genetic compound with the second allele barely expressing mRNA.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

VLCAD is distinguished from matrix-soluble acyl-CoA dehydrogenases by its unique C-terminal domain, homodimeric structure, and localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have for the first time expressed and purified VLCAD using a bacterial system. Recombinant VLCAD had similar biochemical properties to those reported for native VLCAD and the bacterial system was used to study six previously described disease-causing missense mutations including the two most common mild mutations (T220M, V243A), a mutation leading to the severe disease phenotype (R429W), and three mutations in the C-terminal domain (A450P, L462P, and R573W). Of particular interest was the finding that the A450P and L462P bacterial extracts had normal or increased amounts of VLCAD antigen and activity. In the pure form L462P had roughly 30% of wild-type activity while A450P was normal. Using computer modeling both mutations were mapped to a predicted charged surface of VLCAD that we postulate interacts with the mitochondrial membrane.

Six cybrids derived from two asymptomatic members, and nine cybrids derived from three symptomatic members of the Chinese family carrying the C1494T mutation exhibited approximately 38 and 43% decrease in the rate of mitochondrial protein labeling, respectively, compared with twelve cybrids derived from four Chinese control individuals.

Furthermore, the very significant/nearly identical increase in the ratio of doubling times in DMDM medium in the presence/absence of high concentration of paromomycin was observed in symptomatic or asymptomatic cybrid cell lines carrying the C1494T mutation as compared with the average rate in control cell lines. These observations provide the direct biochemical evidences that the C1494T mutation is a pathogenic mtDNA mutation associated with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss.

Infants that do not produce any endogenous acid α-glucosidase, so-called CRIM-negative patients, reportedly develop a strong response. We report the clinical outcome of our Dutch infants in relation to their CRIM status and immune response.
METHODS: Eleven patients were genotyped and their CRIM status was determined. Antibody formation and clinical outcome were assessed for a minimum of 4 years.
RESULTS: ERT was commenced between 0.1 and 8.3 months of age, and patients were treated from 0.3 to 13.7 years. All patients developed antibodies. Those with a high antibody titer (above 1:31,250) had a poor response. The antibody titers varied substantially between patients and did not strictly correlate with the patients' CRIM status. Patients who started ERT beyond 2 months of age tended to develop higher titers than those who started earlier. All three CRIM-negative patients in our study succumbed by the age of 4 years seemingly unrelated to the height of their antibody titer.
CONCLUSION: Antibody formation is a common response to ERT in classic infantile Pompe disease and counteracts the effect of treatment. The counteracting effect seems determined by the antibody:enzyme molecular stoichiometry. The immune response may be minimized by early start of ERT and by immune modulation, as proposed by colleagues. The CRIM-negative status itself seems associated with poor outcome.",PS3_moderate,1,0,,0,

Using a custom capture panel, we discovered novel intronic variants, ENST00000343455.7: c.1752+213A&gt;G and c.1509+16A&gt;G, that appear to interfere with normal splicing. We suggest that when no DICER1 pLOF variants or large deletions are discovered in exonic regions despite strong clinical suspicion, intron sequencing and splicing analysis should be performed.",PS3_supporting,1,0,,0,
27929079,"Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT). MeCP2 binds to chromocentric DNA through its methyl CpG-binding domain (MBD) to regulate gene expression. In heterozygous females the variable phenotypic severity is modulated by non-random X-inactivation, thus making genotype-phenotype comparisons unreliable. However, genotype-phenotype correlations in males with hemizygousMECP2 mutations can provide more accurate insights in to the true biological effect of specific mutations. Here, we compared chromatin organization and binding dynamics for twelve MeCP2 missense mutations (including two novel and the five most common MBD missense RTT mutations) and identifiedacorrelation with phenotype in hemizygous males. We observed impaired interaction of MeCP2-DNA for mutations around the MBD-DNA binding interface, and defective chromatin clustering for distal MBD mutations. Furthermore, binding and mobility dynamics show a gradient of impairment depending on the amino acid properties and tertiary structure within the MBD. Interestingly, a wide range of phenotypic/clinical severity, ranging from neonatal encephalopathy to mild psychiatric abnormalities were observed and all are consistent with our functional/molecular results. Overall, clinical severity showed a direct correlation with the functional impairment of MeCP2. These mechanistic and phenotypic correlations of MeCP2 mutations will enable improved and individualized diagnostics, and may lead to personalized therapeutic interventions.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Many missense mutations causing RTT are clustered in the DNA-binding domain of MeCP2, suggesting that association with chromatin is critical for its function. We identified a second mutational cluster in a previously uncharacterized region of MeCP2. We found that RTT mutations in this region abolished the interaction between MeCP2 and the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complexes. Mice bearing a common missense RTT mutation in this domain exhibited severe RTT-like phenotypes. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that brain dysfunction in RTT is caused by a loss of the MeCP2 'bridge' between the NCoR/SMRT co-repressors and chromatin.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16359515,"BACKGROUND: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by lack of platelet aggregation in response to most physiological agonists and caused by either a lack or dysfunction of the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the molecular basis of GT and characterize the mutations by in vitro expression studies.
PATIENTS: We studied three unrelated patients from southern India whose diagnosis was consistent with GT.
RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates and immunoblotting showed no detectable mature alpha(IIb) in the G128S mutant, in contrast to 6% and 33% of the normal amount of mature alpha(IIb) in the S287L and G357S mutants, respectively. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated pro-alpha(IIb) in the mutants comparable with the normal pro-alpha(IIb), but no conversion to mature alpha(IIb) in the G128S mutant, and only trace conversion to mature alpha(IIb) in the S287L and G357S mutants. The disappearance of pro-alpha(IIb) in the three mutants was similar to that in cells expressing normal alpha(IIb)beta3 or alpha(IIb) only. All three mutants demonstrated pro-alpha(IIb)beta3 complexes and co-localized with an ER marker by immunofluorescence. The G128S mutant showed no co-localization with a Golgi marker, and the other two mutants showed minimal and moderate co-localization with the Golgi marker.
CONCLUSIONS: These three beta-propeller mutations do not affect the production of pro-alpha(IIb), its ability to complex with beta3, or its stability, but do cause variable defects in transport of pro-alpha(IIb)beta3 complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
21029361,"BACKGROUND: Studies of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT)-causing mutations has generated invaluable information on the formation and function of integrin αIIbβ(3).
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mutation in four siblings of an Israeli Arab family affected by GT, and to analyze the relationships between the mutant protein structure and its function using artificial mutations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sequencing disclosed a new A97G transversion in the αIIb gene predicting Asn2Asp substitution at blade 1 of the β-propeller. Alignment with other integrin α subunits revealed that Asn2 is highly conserved. No surface expression of αIIbβ(3) was found in patients' platelets and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with mutated αIIb and WT β(3). Although the αIIbβ(3) was formed, the mutation impaired its intracellular trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations and modeling of the αIIbβ(3) crystal indicated that the Asn2Asp mutation disrupts a hydrogen bond between Asn2 and Leu366 of a calcium binding domain in blade 6, thereby impairing calcium binding that is essential for intracellular trafficking of αIIbβ(3). Substitution of Asn2 to uncharged Ala or Gln partially decreased αIIbβ(3) surface expression, while substitution by negatively or positively charged residues completely abolished surface expression. Unlike αIIbβ(3), αVβ(3) harboring the Asn2Asp mutation was surface expressed by transfected BHK cells, which is consistent with the known lower sensitivity of αVβ(3) to calcium chelation compared with αIIbβ(3).
CONCLUSION: The new GT causing mutation highlights the importance of calcium binding domains in the β-propeller for intracellular trafficking of αIIbβ(3). The mechanism by which the mutation exerts its deleterious effect was elucidated by molecular dynamics.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
9461620,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is one of four flavoproteins which catalyze the initial step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation spiral. By sequence comparison with other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, Glu-422 of VLCAD has been presumed to be the catalytic residue that abstracts the alpha-proton in the alphabeta-dehydrogenation reaction. Replacing Glu-422 with glutamine (E422Q) caused a loss of enzyme activity by preventing the formation of a charge transfer complex between VLCAD and palmitoyl-CoA. This result provides further evidence for Glu-422 being part of the active site of VLCAD. F418L is a disease-causing mutation in human VLCAD deficiency. Unlike wild-type VLCAD, F418L and F418V contained no bound FAD when expressed at extremely high levels in the baculovirus expression system. Although F418T and F418Y bound FAD at a level similar to that of wild-type VLCAD, both showed reduced Vmax values toward palmitoyl-CoA, most likely due to a decrease in the rate of enzyme-bound FAD reduction. These data suggest that Phe-418 is involved in the binding and subsequent reduction of FAD. FAD-deficient VLCADs (F418L, F418V, and apo-VLCAD) showed increased sensitivity to trypsinization. Loss of FAD may change the folding of VLCAD subunit.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25545329,"BACKGROUND: The LDL receptor (LDLR) is a Class I transmembrane protein critical for the clearance of cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles. The N-terminal domain of the LDLR harbours the ligand-binding domain consisting of seven cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids each. Mutations in the LDLR binding domain may result in loss of receptor activity leading to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this study the activity of six mutations located in the cysteine-rich repeats of the LDLR has been investigated.
METHODS: CHO-ldlA7 transfected cells with six different LDLR mutations have been used to analyse in vitro LDLR expression, lipoprotein binding and uptake. Immunoblotting of cell extracts, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy have been performed to determine the effects of these mutations. In silico analysis was also performed to predict the mutation effect.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From the six mutations, p.Arg257Trp turned out to be a non-pathogenic LDLR variant whereas p.Cys116Arg, p.Asp168Asn, p.Asp172Asn, p.Arg300Gly and p.Asp301Gly were classified as binding-defective LDLR variants whose effect is not as severe as null allele mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Amongst the first to be described was the 3302A>G transition which resulted in a substantial accumulation in patient muscle of RNA19, an unprocessed RNA intermediate including mt-16S rRNA, mt-tRNA(Leu(UUR)) and MTND1. We have now been able to further assess the molecular aetiology associated with 3302A>G in transmitochondrial cybrids. Increased steady-state levels of RNA19 was confirmed, although not to the levels previously reported in muscle. This data was consistent with an increase in RNA19 stability. The mutation resulted in decreased mt-tRNA(Leu(UUR)) levels, but its stability was unchanged, consistent with a defect in RNA19 processing responsible for low tRNA levels. A partial defect in aminoacylation was also identified, potentially caused by an alteration in tRNA structure. These deficiencies lead to a severe defect in respiration in the transmitochondrial cybrids, consistent with the profound mitochondrial disorder originally associated with this mutation.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Genetic studies identified a novel, heteroplasmic tRNA mutation at nt 10010. This T-->C transition is located in the DHU loop of mitochondrial tRNA(Gly). In skeletal muscle, it was present at lower levels in cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-normal (87.2% +/- 11%) compared with COX-deficient fibers (97.3% +/- 2.6%); it was found in skin fibroblasts and blood cells, but at lower levels of heteroplasmy (15% +/- 6% and 17% +/- 10%, respectively). A second, heteroplasmic transition (A-->G), at nt 5656, showed a different distribution than the tRNA(Gly) mutation, with very low levels in skeletal muscle (< 3%) but higher levels in blood (22.7% +/- 3%) and skin fibroblasts (21% +/- 2%). These transitions were followed both in vivo, by repeat biopsy and blood sampling, and in vitro, by establishing primary cultures of myoblasts and skin fibroblasts. Repeat muscle biopsy showed a dramatic increase in COX-deficient fibers, but not of the tRNAGly mutation. Indeed, no significant change in heteroplasmy was measured for either substitution in muscle or blood. In vitro analysis gave very different results. The T10010C was not found in cultured myoblasts, even at early passage. In uncloned fibroblasts, the T10010C was stable (approximately 10%) for several passages but then gradually was lost. In contrast, the A5656G rose progressively from 27% to 91%.

These disorders are currently incurable and effectively untreatable, with heterogeneous penetrance, presentation and prognosis. To address the lack of effective treatment for these disorders, we exploited a recently developed mouse model that recapitulates common molecular features of heteroplasmic mtDNA disease in cardiac tissue: the m.5024C&gt;T tRNAAla mouse. Through application of a programmable nuclease therapy approach, using systemically administered, mitochondrially targeted zinc-finger nucleases (mtZFN) delivered by adeno-associated virus, we induced specific elimination of mutant mtDNA across the heart, coupled to a reversion of molecular and biochemical phenotypes.

Here we report the adaptation of a gene editing platform based on the I-CreI meganuclease known as ARCUS®. These mitochondrial-targeted meganucleases (mitoARCUS) have a relatively small size, are monomeric, and can recognize sequences differing by as little as one base pair. We show the development of a mitoARCUS specific for the mouse m.5024C&gt;T mutation in the mt-tRNAAla gene and its delivery to mice intravenously using AAV9 as a vector.

The T8306C mutation was heteroplasmic in several tissues of the proband, while it was absent from his asymptomatic siblings. Single fibre analysis confirmed the segregation of higher mutational load in cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres.

14960712,"We report here the biochemical characterization of the deafness-associated mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(UCN)) T7511C mutation, in conjunction with homoplasmic ND1 T3308C and tRNA(Ala) T5655C mutations using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an African family into human mtDNA-less (rho degrees ) cells. Three cybrids derived from an affected matrilineal relative carrying the homoplasmic T7511C mutation, exhibited approximately 75% decrease in the tRNA(Ser(UCN)) level, compared with three control cybrids. This amount of reduction in the tRNA(Ser(UCN)) level is below a proposed threshold to support a normal rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis in lymphoblastoid cell lines. This defect is likely a primary contributor to approximately 52% reduction in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis and marked defects in respiration and growth properties in galactose-containing medium. Interestingly, the T5655C mutation produces approximately 50% reduction in the tRNA(Ala) level in mutant cells. Strikingly, the T3308C mutation causes a significant decrease both in the amount of ND1 mRNA and co-transcribed tRNA(Leu(UUR)) in mutant cells. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunctions caused by the T5655C and T3308C mutations may modulate the phenotypic manifestation of the T7511C mutation. These observations imply that a combination of the T7511C mutation with two mtDNA mutations accounts for the high penetrance of deafness in this family.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Strikingly, members of a Chinese family bearing both the YARS2 p.191Gly&gt;Val and m.7511A&gt;G mutations displayed much higher penetrance of deafness than those pedigrees carrying only the m.7511A&gt;G mutation. The m.7511A&gt;G mutation changed the A4:U69 base-pairing to G4:U69 pairing at the aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNASer(UCN) and perturbed tRNASer(UCN) structure and function, including an increased melting temperature, altered conformation, instability, and aberrant aminoacylation of mutant tRNA. Using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from symptomatic and asymptomatic members of these Chinese families and control subjects, we show that cell lines harboring only the m.7511A&gt;G or p.191Gly&gt;Val mutation revealed relatively mild defects in tRNASer(UCN) or tRNATyr metabolism, respectively.

Long ((L)) and short ((S)) forms of the tRNase Z gene are present in the human genome. tRNase Z(L) processes a nuclear-encoded pre-tRNA approximately 1600-fold more efficiently than tRNase Z(S) and is predicted to have a strong mitochondrial transport signal. tRNase Z(L) could, thus, process both nuclear- and mitochondrially encoded pre-tRNAs. More than 150 pathogenesis-associated mutations have been found in the mitochondrial genome, most of them in the 22 mitochondrially encoded tRNAs.

We have systematically explored the effect of pathogenic mutations on tRNA(Ile) precursor 3' end maturation in vitro by 3'-tRNase. Strikingly, four pathogenic tRNA(Ile) mutations reduce 3'-tRNase processing efficiency (V(max) / K(M)) to approximately 10-fold below that of wild-type, principally due to lower V(max). The structural impact of mutations was sought by secondary structure probing and wild-type tRNA(Ile) precursor was found to fold into a canonical cloverleaf. Among the mutant tRNA(Ile) precursors with the greatest 3' end processing deficiencies, only G4309A displays a secondary structure substantially different from wild-type, with changes in the T domain proximal to the substitution.

22698810,"In about 20-30% of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, phenylalanine (Phe) levels can be controlled by cofactor 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) administration. The phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype has a predictive value concerning BH(4)-response and therefore a correct assessment of the mutation molecular pathology is important. Mutations that disturb the splicing of exons (e.g. interplay between splice site strength and regulatory sequences like exon splicing enhancers (ESEs)/exon splicing silencers (ESSs)) may cause different severity of PKU. In this study, we identified PAH exon 11 as a vulnerable exon and used patient derived lymphoblast cell lines and PAH minigenes to study the molecular defect that impacted pre-mRNA processing. We showed that the c.1144T>C and c.1066-3C>T mutations cause exon 11 skipping, while the c.1139C>T mutation is neutral or slightly beneficial. The c.1144T>C mutation resides in a putative splicing enhancer motif and binding by splicing factors SF2/ASF, SRp20 and SRp40 is disturbed. Additional mutations in potential splicing factor binding sites contributed to elucidate the pathogenesis of mutations in PAH exon 11. We suggest that PAH exon 11 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site and that this makes exon 11 inclusion dependent on an ESE spanning position c.1144. Importantly, this implies that other mutations in exon 11 may affect splicing, since splicing is often determined by a fine balance between several positive and negative splicing regulatory elements distributed throughout the exon. Finally, we identified a pseudoexon in intron 11, which would have pathogenic consequences if activated by mutations or improved splicing conditions. Exonic mutations that disrupt splicing are unlikely to facilitate response to BH(4) and may lead to inconsistent genotype-phenotype correlations. Therefore, recognizing such mutations enhances our ability to predict the BH(4)-response.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
36922881,"BACKGROUND: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare mesenchymal malignancy of the lung and is the most common pulmonary malignancy in infants and children. Cystic PPB, the earliest form of PPB occurring from birth to approximately two years of age, is often mistaken for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation, as the two entities can be difficult to distinguish on imaging and pathology. Diagnosis of PPB should prompt workup for DICER1 syndrome, an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome. We report a newborn with a congenital PPB presenting with tachypnea and hypoxia, who was found to have variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in DICER1.
CASE PRESENTATION: A term female infant developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. Initial imaging was concerning for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation versus congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and she was transferred to a quaternary neonatal intensive care unit for management and workup. Chest CT angiography demonstrated a macrocytic multicystic lesion within the right lower lobe without systemic arterial supply. The pediatric surgery team was consulted, and the neonate underwent right lower lobectomy. Pathology revealed a type I PPB. Oncology and genetics consultants recommended observation without chemotherapy and single gene sequencing of DICER1, which identified a germline VUS in DICER1 predicted to alter splicing. RNA-sequencing from blood demonstrated that the variant resulted in an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids in a majority of transcripts from the affected allele. Due to the patient's young age at presentation and high clinical suspicion for DICER1 syndrome, tumor surveillance was initiated. Renal and pelvic ultrasonography were unremarkable.
CONCLUSION: We present the case of a term neonate with respiratory distress and cystic lung mass, found to have a type I PPB with a germline VUS in DICER1 that likely increased her risk of DICER1-related tumors. Nearly 70% of patients with PPB demonstrate germline mutations in DICER1. Review of RNA sequencing data demonstrates the difficulty in classifying splice variants such as this. Penetrance is low, and many patients with pathogenic DICER1 variants do not develop a malignancy. Best practice surgical and oncologic recommendations include an individualized approach and tumor board discussion.

METHODS: Over a 2-year period, genetics providers at a single institution referred 26 cases for clinical RNA-seq. Cases had either no candidate variant identified by prior testing or a VUS suspected to impact splicing or expression. A committee reviewed each submission to ensure it met study criteria.
RESULTS: Among 26 cases, 8 could not be sequenced because of poor expression in an accessible tissue, 2 did not meet inclusion criteria, 3 were solved prior to collection, and 4 families declined participation or did not complete sample collection. For the 9 cases sequenced, the clinical laboratory reported two positive, four negative, and three ""indeterminate."" For all three indeterminate cases, original RNA-seq data was manually evaluated and deemed explanatory.

Because the current understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms of these mutations is limited, there is no efficient method to treat their associated mitochondrial diseases. Here, we use a variety of known mutations in hmt-tRNA(Phe) to investigate the mechanisms that lead to malfunctions. We tested the impact of hmt-tRNA(Phe) mutations on aminoacylation, structure, and translation elongation-factor binding. The majority of the mutants were pleiotropic, exhibiting defects in aminoacylation, global structure, and elongation-factor binding. One notable exception was the G34A anticodon mutation of hmt-tRNA(Phe) (mitochondrial DNA mutation G611A), which is associated with MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers). In vitro, the G34A mutation decreases aminoacylation activity by 100-fold, but does not affect global folding or recognition by elongation factor. Furthermore, G34A hmt-tRNA(Phe) does not undergo adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, ruling out miscoding as a possible mechanism for mitochondrial malfunction. To improve the aminoacylation state of the mutant tRNA, we modified the tRNA binding domain of the nucleus-encoded human mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, which aminoacylates hmt-tRNA(Phe) with cognate phenylalanine.

Cybrid cell lines, derived from the osteosarcoma human cell line 143B, harboring, either wild-type mitochondrial DNA (Cy143Bwt), cells with mitochondria with mutated DNA that causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Cy143Bmut), as well as cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (143B-Rho0), were irradiated with 0.2 Gy and 2.0 Gy. Evaluation of the non-targeted (or bystander) effects in non-irradiated cells were assessed by using conditioned media from the irradiated cells. DNA double stranded breaks were assessed with the γH2AX assay. Both directly irradiated cells and cells treated with the conditioned media, showed increased DNA damage. The effect of the irradiated cells media was different according to the cell line it derived from: from Cy143Bwt cells irradiated with 0.2 Gy (low dose) and from Cy143Bmut irradiated with 2.0 Gy (high dose) induced highest DNA damage. Notably, media obtained from cells without mtDNA, the143B-Rho0 cell line, produced no effect in DNA damage. These results point to a possible role of mitochondria in the radiation-induced non-targeted effects. Furthermore, it indicates that cybrid models are valuable tools for radiobiological studies.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
23418307,"Cytochrome b is the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of the mitochondrial complex III (CIII), the functional bottleneck of the respiratory chain. Previously, the human cytochrome b missense mutation m.15579A>G, which substitutes the Tyr 278 with Cys (p.278Y>C), was identified in a patient with severe exercise intolerance and multisystem manifestations. In this study, we characterized the biochemical properties of cybrids carrying this mutation and report that the homoplasmic p.278Y>C mutation caused a dramatic reduction in the CIII activity and in CIII-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis. However, the CI, CI + CIII and CII + CIII activities and the rate of ATP synthesis driven by the CI or CII substrate were only partially reduced or unaffected. Consistent with these findings, mutated cybrids maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of oligomycin, indicating that it originated from the respiratory electron transport chain. The p.278Y>C mutation enhanced superoxide production, as indicated by direct measurements in mitochondria and by the imbalance of glutathione homeostasis in intact cybrids. Remarkably, although the assembly of CI or CIII was not affected, the examination of respiratory supercomplexes revealed that the amounts of CIII dimer and III2IV1 were reduced, whereas those of I1III2IVn slightly increased. We therefore suggest that the deleterious effects of p.278Y>C mutation on cytochrome b are palliated when CIII is assembled into the supercomplexes I1III2IVn, in contrast to when it is found alone. These findings underline the importance of supramolecular interactions between complexes for maintaining a basal respiratory chain activity and shed light to the molecular basis of disease manifestations associated with this mutation.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We characterized six rare APC variants in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis at the mRNA level. APC variants c.531 + 5G>C and c.532-8G>A in intron 4, c.1409-2_1409delAGG in intron 10, c.1548G>A in exon 11, and a large duplication of exons 10 and 11 result in a premature stop codon attributable to aberrant transcripts whereas the variant c.1742A>G leads to the in-frame deletion of exon 13 and results in the removal of a functional motif. Mutation c.1548G>A was detected in the index patient but not in his affected father, suggesting mutational mosaicism. A literature review shows that most of the rare APC variants detected by routine diagnostics and further analyzed at the transcript level were evaluated as pathogenic. The majority of rare APC variants, particularly those located close to exon-intron boundaries, could be classified as pathogenic because of aberrant splicing. Our study shows that the characterization of rare variants at the mRNA level is crucial for the evaluation of pathogenicity and underlying mutational mechanisms, and could lead to better treatment modalities.",PS3_verystrong,1,1,,1,
20649969,"BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by germline mutations within the APC gene, is characterized by early onset colorectal cancer as a consequence of the intrinsic phenotypic feature of multiple colorectal adenomatic polyps. The genetic investigation of Greek adenomatous polyposis families was performed in respects to APC and MUTYH germline mutations. Additionally, all available published mutations were considered in order to define the APC mutation spectrum in Greece.
METHODS: A cohort of 25 unrelated adenomatous polyposis families of Greek origin has been selected. Genetic testing included direct sequencing of APC and MUTYH genes. APC gene was also checked for large genomic rearrangements by MLPA.
RESULTS: Analysis of the APC gene performed in a Greek cohort of twenty five FAP families revealed eighteen different germline mutations in twenty families (80%), four of which novel. Mutations were scattered between exon 3 and codon 1503 of exon 15, while no large genomic rearrangements were identified.
CONCLUSION: This concise report describes the spectrum of all APC mutations identified in Greek FAP families, including four novel mutations. It is concluded that the Greek population is characterized by genetic heterogeneity, low incidence of genomic rearrangements in APC gene and lack of founder mutation in FAP syndrome.",PS3_moderate,1,0,,0,
18166348,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We identified the APC N1026S variant of unknown malignant potential in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in a Spanish attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) family. The variant was located in the first of the 4 highly conserved 15-amino acid (AA) repeats within the beta-catenin union domain. Our aim was to determine its functional relevance to establish its pathogenicity.
METHODS: N1026S variant was analyzed in 22 members of the AFAP family studied, in 236 sporadic colorectal cancer cases, 203 matched controls, and 205 unrelated familial colorectal cancer cases. To assess its effects on beta-catenin binding, beta-catenin/Tcf-4-mediated transcription and beta-catenin subcellular distribution we performed affinity chromatography experiments, BIAcore 1000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) assays, luciferase reporter assays, assessment of c-myc messenger RNA levels, and cell fractionation.
RESULTS: N1026S variant cosegregated with the disease in the AFAP family studied. None of the sporadic or familial cases as well as the controls analyzed was positive for the variant. N1026S variant completely precluded beta-catenin binding to the first 15-AA repeat and diminished it when all four 15-AA repeats were present. Expression of APC N1026S in SW480 and DLD-1 cells did not diminish beta-catenin/Tcf-4-mediated transcription as effectively as APC wild-type. N1026S did not decrease c-myc transcription in DLD1 cells and nuclear beta-catenin in SW480 cells as effectively as WT.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly support a pathogenic role of the APC N1026S variant in the AFAP phenotype, reinforcing the importance of functional characterization of APC variants for genetic counseling.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25941542,"BACKGROUND: The overwhelming majority (approximately 80%) of individuals with classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) exhibit mutations in the coding sequence of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. Families without detectable APC mutations are unable to benefit from the use of genetic testing for clinical management of this autosomal dominant syndrome.
METHODS: We used exome sequencing and linkage analysis, coupled with second-generation sequencing of the APC locus including non-coding regions to investigate three APC mutation-negative classical FAP families.
RESULTS: We identified a novel ~11 kb deletion localized 44 kb upstream of the transcription start site of APC that encompasses the APC 1B promoter and exon. This deletion was present only in affected family members of one kindred with classical FAP. Furthermore, this same deletion with identical breakpoints was found in the probands of two additional APC mutation-negative classical FAP kindreds. Phasing analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the deletion site in the three probands showed evidence of a shared haplotype, suggesting a common founder deletion in the three kindreds. SNP analysis within the coding sequence of APC, revealed that this ~11 kb deletion was accompanied by silencing of one of the APC alleles in blood-derived RNA of affected individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the causal role of a novel promoter deletion in FAP and suggest that non-coding deletions, identifiable using second-generation sequencing methods, may account for a significant fraction of APC mutation-negative classical FAP families.",PS3_verystrong,1,1,,1,
27217144,"Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Here we applied whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to the DNA of a sporadic FAP patient in which we did not find any pathological APC mutations by direct sequencing. WGS identified a promoter deletion of approximately 10 kb encompassing promoter 1B and exon1B of APC. Additional allele-specific expression analysis by deep cDNA sequencing revealed that the deletion reduced the expression of the mutated APC allele to as low as 11.2% in the total APC transcripts, suggesting that the residual mutant transcripts were driven by other promoter(s). Furthermore, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) demonstrated that the deleted promoter 1B region is responsible for the great majority of APC transcription in many tissues except the brain. The deletion decreased the transcripts of APC-1B to 39-45% in the patient compared to the healthy controls, but it did not decrease those of APC-1A. Different deletions including promoter 1B have been reported in FAP patients. Taken together, our results strengthen the evidence that analysis of structural variations in promoter 1B should be considered for the FAP patients whose pathological mutations are not identified by conventional direct sequencing.",PS3_verystrong,1,1,,1,
18433509,"BACKGROUND: The dominantly inherited condition familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by germline mutations in the APC gene. Finding the causative mutations has great implications for the families. Correlating the genotypes to the phenotypes could help to improve the diagnosis and follow-up of patients.
METHODS: Mutation screening of APC and the clinical characterization of 96 unrelated FAP patients from the Swedish Polyposis Registry was performed. In addition to generally used mutation screening methods, analyses of splicing-affecting mutations and investigations of the presence of low-frequency mutation alleles, indicating mosaics, have been performed, as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect lowered expression of APC.
RESULTS: Sixty-one different APC mutations in 81 of the 96 families were identified and 27 of those are novel. We have previously shown that 6 of the 96 patients carried biallelic MUTYH mutations. The 9 mutation-negative cases all display an attenuated or atypical phenotype. Probands with a genotype (codon 1250-1464) predicting a severe phenotype had a median age at diagnosis of 21.8 (range, 11-49) years compared with 34.4 (range, 14-57) years among those with mutations outside this region (P < 0.017). Dense polyposis (> 1000) occurred in 75% of the probands with a severe phenotype compared with 30% in those with mutations outside this region. The morbidity in colorectal cancer among probands was 25% at a mean age of 37.5 years and 29% at a mean age of 46.6 years.
CONCLUSION: Using a variety of mutation-detection techniques, we have achieved a 100% detection frequency in classical FAP. Probands with APC mutations outside codon 1250-1464, although exhibiting a less-severe phenotype, are at high risk of having a colorectal cancer at diagnosis indicating that age at diagnosis is as important as the severity of the disease for colorectal cancer morbidity.",PS3_verystrong,1,0,,0,

Clinical genetic testing fails to identify disease causing mutations in up to 20% of clinically apparent FAP cases. Following the inclusion of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probes specific for APC promoter 1B, seven probands were identified with a deletion of promoter 1B. Using haplotype analysis spanning the APC locus, the seven families appear to be identical by descent from a common founder. The clinical phenotype of 19 mutation carriers is classical FAP with colectomy at an average age of 24. The majority of cases had a large number of duodenal and gastric polyps. Measurements of allele-specific expression of APC mRNA using TaqMan assay confirmed that relative expression in the allele containing the promoter 1B deletion was reduced 42-98%, depending on tissue type.

However, a puzzling infantile disorder, long known as 'benign cytochrome c oxidase deficiency myopathy' is an exception because it shows spontaneous recovery if infants survive the first months of life. Current investigations cannot distinguish those with a good prognosis from those with terminal disease, making it very difficult to decide when to continue intensive supportive care. Here we define the principal molecular basis of the disorder by identifying a maternally inherited, homoplasmic m.14674T>C mt-tRNA(Glu) mutation in 17 patients from 12 families. Our results provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of the mutation and show that tissue-specific mechanisms downstream of tRNA(Glu) may explain the spontaneous recovery.

Our transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of patient muscle suggests a stepwise mechanism where first, the integrated stress response associated with increased FGF21 and GDF15 expression enhances the metabolism modulated by serine biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism, TCA lipid oxidation and amino acid availability, while in the second step mTOR activation leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data suggest that the spontaneous recovery in infants with digenic mutations may be modulated by the above described changes.

15554876,"Two mutations (G8363A and A8296G) in the mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) tRNA(Lys) gene have been associated with severe mitochondrial diseases in a number of reports. Their functional significance, however, remains unknown. We have already shown that homoplasmic cybrids harbouring the A8296G mutation display normal oxidative phosphorylation, although the possibility of a subtle change in mitochondrial respiratory capacity remains an open issue. We have now investigated the pathogenic mechanism of another mutation in the tRNA(Lys) gene (G8363A) by repopulating an mtDNA-less human osteosarcoma cell line with mitochondria harbouring either this genetic variant alone or an unusual combination of the two mutations (A8296G+G8363A). Cybrids homoplasmic for the single G8363A or the A8296G+G8363A mutations have defective respiratory-chain enzyme activities and low oxygen consumption, indicating a severe impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Generation of G8363A cybrids within a wild-type or the A8296G mtDNA genetic backgrounds resulted in an important alteration in the conformation of the tRNA(Lys), not affecting tRNA steady-state levels. Moreover, mutant cybrids have an important decrease in the proportion of amino-acylated tRNA(Lys) and, consequently, mitochondrial protein synthesis is greatly decreased. Our results demonstrate that the pathogenicity of the G8363A mutation is due to a change in the conformation of the tRNA that severely impairs aminoacylation in the absence of changes in tRNA stability. The only effect detected in the A8296G mutation is a moderate decrease in the aminoacylation capacity, which does not affect mitochondrial protein biosynthesis.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

By contrast cybrids containing mild mutant mtDNAs exhibit different tumorigenic capacities, depending on OXPHOS dysfunction.The differences in tumorigenicity correlate with an enhanced resistance to apoptosis and high levels of NOX expression. However, the final capacity of the different cybrid cell lines to generate tumors is most likely a consequence of a complex array of pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic factors associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.Our results demonstrate the essential role of mtDNA in tumorigenesis and explain the numerous and varied mtDNA mutations found in human tumors, most of which give rise to mild mitochondrial dysfunction.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
15233628,"HNF4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) belongs to a complex transcription factor network that is crucial for the function of hepatocytes and pancreatic beta-cells. In these cells, it activates the expression of a very large number of genes, including genes involved in the transport and metabolism of glucose and lipids. Mutations in the HNF4alpha gene correlate with MODY1 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1), a form of type II diabetes characterized by an impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. The MODY1 G115S (Gly115-->Ser) HNF4alpha mutation is located in the DNA-binding domain of this nuclear receptor. We show here that the G115S mutation failed to affect HNF4alpha-mediated transcription on apolipoprotein promoters in HepG2 cells. Conversely, in pancreatic beta-cell lines, this mutation resulted in strong impairments of HNF4alpha transcriptional activity on the promoters of LPK (liver pyruvate kinase) and HNF1alpha, with this transcription factor playing a key role in endocrine pancreas. We show as well that the G115S mutation creates a PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation site, and that PKA-mediated phosphorylation results in a decreased transcriptional activity of the mutant. Moreover, the G115E (Gly115-->Glu) mutation mimicking phosphorylation reduced HNF4alpha DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. Our results may account for the 100% penetrance of diabetes in human carriers of this mutation. In addition, they suggest that introduction of a phosphorylation site in the DNA-binding domain may represent a new mechanism by which a MODY1 mutation leads to loss of HNF4alpha function.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Pre-tRNAs thus require precise endonucleolytic excision. Furthermore, the CCA triplet which forms the 3' end of all tRNAs is not encoded, but must be synthesized by the CCA-adding enzyme after 3' end cleavage. Amino acid attachment to the CCA of mature tRNA is performed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which, like the preceding processing enzymes, are nuclear-encoded and imported into mitochondria. Here, we critically review the effectiveness and reliability of evidence obtained from reactions with in vitro transcripts that pathogenesis-associated mutant mitochondrial tRNAs can lead to deficiencies in tRNA 3' end metabolism (3' end cleavage, CCA addition and aminoacylation) toward an understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying human tRNA disorders.

15100439,"In vitro transcription has proven to be a successful tool for preparation of functional RNAs, especially in the tRNA field, in which, despite the absence of post-transcriptional modifications, transcripts are correctly folded and functionally active. Human mitochondrial (mt) tRNA(Lys) deviates from this principle and folds into various inactive conformations, due to the absence of the post-transcriptional modification m(1)A9 which hinders base-pairing with U64 in the native tRNA. Unavailability of a functional transcript is a serious drawback for structure/function investigations as well as in deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which point mutations in the mt tRNA(Lys) gene cause severe human disorders. Here, we show that an engineered in vitro transcribed ""pseudo-WT"" tRNA(Lys) variant is efficiently recognized by lysyl-tRNA synthetase and can substitute for the WT tRNA as a valuable reference molecule. This has been exploited in a systematic analysis of the effects on aminoacylation of nine pathology-related mutations described so far. The sole mutation located in a loop of the tRNA secondary structure, A8344G, does not affect aminoacylation efficiency. Out of eight mutations located in helical domains converting canonical Watson-Crick pairs into G-U pairs or C.A mismatches, six have no effect on aminoacylation (A8296G, U8316C, G8342A, U8356C, U8362G, G8363A), and two lead to drastic decreases (5000- to 7000-fold) in lysylation efficiencies (G8313A and G8328A).

We detected a marked reduction in tRNA(Asn) steady-state levels which was not associated with an accumulation of intermediate transcripts containing tRNA(Asn) sequences or decreased transcription. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the residual tRNA(Asn) fraction in mutant cybrids had an altered conformation, suggesting that the mutation destabilized the tRNA(Asn) secondary or tertiary structure.

To fulfill the World Health Organization recommendation, the Portuguese FH Study was established. Here, we report the results of the past 15 years and present practical considerations concerning the genetic diagnosis of FH based on our experience.
METHODS: Our approach comprises a biochemical and molecular study and is divided into five phases, including the study of whole APOB and functional assays.
RESULTS: A total of 2,122 individuals were enrolled. A putative pathogenic variant was identified in 660 heterozygous patients: LDLR (623), APOB (33), and PCSK9 (4); 8 patients presented with homozygous FH. A detection rate of 41.5% was observed. A stricter biochemical criteria was shown to improve patient identification. Overall, we have identified 3.4% and 80% of all heterozygous and homozygous patients, respectively, estimated to exist in our country.
CONCLUSION: The Portuguese FH Study has established the genetic diagnosis of FH in Portugal and is committed to continue the investigation of the genetic complexity of FH. Genetic diagnosis of FH should be expanded to include the study of all coding/flanking regions of APOB and functional in vitro studies, to improve the correct patient identification, and to avoid misdiagnosis.Genet Med 18 4, 316-324.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,0,

The current study investigated the reasons for the higher prevalence of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy in males, exploring the potential compensatory effects of oestrogens on mutant cell metabolism. Control and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy osteosarcoma-derived cybrids (11778/ND4, 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6) were grown in glucose or glucose-free, galactose-supplemented medium. After having shown the nuclear and mitochondrial localization of oestrogen receptors in cybrids, experiments were carried out by adding 100 nM of 17β-oestradiol. In a set of experiments, cells were pre-incubated with the oestrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy cybrids in galactose medium presented overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which led to decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased apoptotic rate, loss of cell viability and hyper-fragmented mitochondrial morphology compared with control cybrids. Treatment with 17β-oestradiol significantly rescued these pathological features and led to the activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2. In addition, 17β-oestradiol induced a general activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and a small although significant improvement in energetic competence. All these effects were oestrogen receptor mediated. Finally, we showed that the oestrogen receptor β localizes to the mitochondrial network of human retinal ganglion cells.

The addition of rotenone to HL180 cells and of antimycin A to XTC.UC1 cells caused fast mitochondrial membrane depolarization that was prevented by treatment with cyclosporin A, intracellular Ca2+ chelators, and antioxidant. Both cell lines also displayed an anomalous response to oligomycin, with rapid onset of depolarization that was prevented by cyclosporin A and by overexpression of Bcl-2. These findings indicate that depolarization by respiratory chain inhibitors and oligomycin was due to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). A shift of the threshold voltage for PTP opening close to the resting potential may therefore be the underlying cause facilitating cell death in diseases affecting complex I activity. This study provides a unifying reading frame for previous observations on mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic defects, and Ca2+ deregulation in mitochondrial diseases. Therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing the PTP voltage threshold may be instrumental in ameliorating the course of complex I-dependent mitochondrial diseases.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
12446713,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a maternally inherited form of central vision loss, is associated with mitochondrial DNA pathogenic point mutations affecting different subunits of complex I. We here report that osteosarcoma-derived cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrid) cell lines harboring one of the three most frequent LHON pathogenic mutations, at positions 11778/ND4, 3460/ND1, and 14484/ND6, undergo cell death when galactose replaces glucose in the medium, contrary to control cybrids that maintain some growth capabilities. This is a well known way to produce a metabolic stress, forcing the cells to rely on the mitochondrial respiratory chain to produce ATP. We demonstrate that LHON cybrid cell death is apoptotic, showing chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA laddering. Moreover, we also document the mitochondrial involvement in the activation of the apoptotic cascade, as shown by the increased release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in LHON cybrid cells as compared with controls. Cybrids bearing the 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6 mutations seemed more readily prone to undergo apoptosis as compared with the 11778/ND4 mutation. In conclusion, LHON cybrid cells forced by the reduced rate of glycolytic flux to utilize oxidative metabolism are sensitized to an apoptotic death through a mechanism involving mitochondria.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
35858578,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a disease associated with a mitochondrial DNA mutation, is characterized by blindness due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, which form the optic nerve. We show that a sustained pathological autophagy and compartment-specific mitophagy activity affects LHON patient-derived cells and cybrids, as well as induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived neurons. This is variably counterbalanced by compensatory mitobiogenesis. The aberrant quality control disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis as reflected by defective bioenergetics and excessive reactive oxygen species production, a stress phenotype that ultimately challenges cell viability by increasing the rate of apoptosis. We counteract this pathological mechanism by using autophagy regulators (clozapine and chloroquine) and redox modulators (idebenone), as well as genetically activating mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1-α overexpression). This study substantially advances our understanding of LHON pathophysiology, providing an integrated paradigm for pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases and druggable targets for therapy.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

The mutant mtDNA was heteroplasmic (85% mutant) in muscle but was undetectable in white blood cells from the patient and her mother. Analysis of single muscle fibres indicated that mutant mtDNAs severely impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory chain activity, but only when present at greater than 90%.

Histopathologically, abundant COX-deficient fibres were present in muscle with immunofluorescence analysis confirming the loss of mitochondrial complex I and IV proteins. Molecular genetic analysis identified a rare heteroplasmic m.15990C&gt;T mt-tRNAPro variant reported previously in a single patient with childhood-onset myopathy. The variant in our patient was restricted to muscle. Single muscle fibre analysis identified higher heteroplasmy load in COX-deficient fibres than COX-normal fibres, confirming segregation of high heteroplasmic load with a biochemical defect.

15100232,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a modular protein involved in the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. Mutations to the receptor result in familial hypercholesterolemia, and over 60 of these occur in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain pair. Two selected mutations in this region (G322S and R329P) were introduced into the domain pair and analyzed by in vitro refolding. Both exhibited differing levels of protein misfolding with R329P being the most pronounced. Solution NMR studies of the mutant domain pairs after purification established that a fraction of protein maintains a native-like fold and that this fraction contains two intact calcium-binding sites. An in vivo analysis of intact receptors containing these binding sites showed significantly reduced cell-surface expression compared with the native LDL receptor levels, again with R329P showing the most severe decrease. The sum of these results suggests that either local changes in structure or domain misfolding may be associated with the mutations. There is also the possibility that the misfolding of the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like pair region is propagated to other regions of the intact receptor, resulting in more global defects. Surprisingly, for both mutants, those full-length receptors that fold and reach the cell surface retain the ability to bind LDL and release the ligand upon exposure to low pH. This analysis provides significant insight into the protein defect resulting from each of the two mutations and allows their classification to be 2B (partially transport-defective). The results also highlight a range of misfolding defects that may be associated with familial hypercholesterolemia and may enable the prediction of the consequences of homologous disease-causing mutations to other proteins.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

The aim of this study is to investigate the genetic mutations in FH patients and verify their pathogenicity. First of all, a pedigree investigation was conducted in one family diagnosed with FH using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. The high-throughput sequencing was performed on three family members to explore genetic mutations. The effects of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) variants on their expression levels and activity were further validated by silico analysis and functional studies. The results revealed that LDLC levels of the proband and his daughter were abnormally elevated. The whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm that there were two LDLR missense mutations (LDLR c.226 G &gt; C, c.1003 G &gt; T) in this family. Bioinformatic analysis (Mutationtaster) indicated that these two mutations might be disease-causing variants.

24671153,"BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease that primarily results from mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. We investigated two unrelated Chinese FH patients using gene screening and functional analysis to reveal the pathogenicity and the mechanism by which these mutations cause FH.
METHODS: First, the LDLR gene was sequenced in these patients. Then, mutant receptors were transfected into human embryo kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells, and a confocal laser-scanning microscope was used to observe the localization of mutant proteins. Further, the expression and the internalization activity were analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, LDLR protein expression and stability was detected by western blot.
RESULTS: Two different LDLR class 2B mutations were detected in two patients. The C201F mutation is a known mutation. However, the G615V mutation is novel. Flow cytometry showed that the expression and internalization activity of the mutant LDLRs were reduced to 73.6% and 82.6% for G615V and 33.2% and 33.5% for C201F, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two LDLR mutations in Chinese patients with FH and analyzed the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of these patients. We found that these mutant LDLRs were defective in transport, which led to a reduction in cholesterol clearance. These results increase our understanding of the mutational spectrum of FH in the Chinese population.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
12527767,"The U3271C mutation affecting the human mitochondrial transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)) (hs mt tRNA) is correlated with diabetes and mitochondrial encephalopathies. We have explored the relationship between the structural effects of this mutation and its impact on function using chemical probing experiments and in vitro aminoacylation assays to investigate a series of tRNA constructs. Chemical probing experiments indicate that the U3271C substitution, which replaces an AU pair with a CA mispair, significantly destabilizes the anticodon stem. The introduction of a compensatory A3261G mutation reintroduces base pairing at this site and restores the structure of this domain. In fact, the anticodon stem of the A3261G/U3271C mutant appears more structured than wild-type (WT) hs mt tRNA(Leu(UUR)), indicating that the entirely AU stem of the native tRNA is intrinsically weak. The results of the chemical probing experiments are mirrored in the aminoacylation activities of the mutants. The U3271C substitution decreases aminoacylation reactivity relative to the WT tRNA due to an increase in K(m) for the pathogenic mutant. The binding defect is a direct result of the structural disruption caused by the pathogenic mutation, as the introduction of the stabilizing compensatory mutation restores aminoacylation activity. Other examples of functional defects associated with the disruption of weak domains in hs mt tRNAs have been reported, indicating that the effects of pathogenic mutations may be amplified by the fragile structures that are characteristic of this class of tRNAs.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Clinical features often depend on the tRNA species and/or positions of the mutations; however, molecular pathogenesis elucidating the relation between the location of the mutations and their leading phenotype are not fully understood. We report here that mitochondrial tRNAs(Leu(UUR)) harboring one of five mutations found in tissues from patients with symptoms of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (A3243G, G3244A, T3258C, T3271C, and T3291C) lacked the normal taurine-containing modification (5-taurinomethyluridine) at the anticodon wobble position. In contrast, mitochondrial tRNAs(Leu(UUR)) with different mutations found in patients that have mitochondrial diseases but do not show the MELAS symptoms (G3242A, T3250C, C3254T, and A3280G) had the normal 5-taurinomethyluridine modifications. These observations were made by using a modified primer extension technique that can detect the modification deficiency in the extremely limited quantities of mutant tRNAs obtainable from patient tissues. These results strongly suggest deficient wobble modification could be a key molecular factor responsible for the phenotypic features of MELAS, which can explain why the different MELAS-associated mutations result in indistinguishable clinical features.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

A point mutation at nucleotide position 3243 or 3271 is associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes and maternally inherited diabetes with deafness. Detailed studies on two tRNAs(Leu)(UUR) with the 3243 or 3271 mutation revealed some common characteristics in cybrid cells: (i) a decreased life span, resulting in a 70% decrease in the amounts of the tRNAs in the steady state, (ii) a slight decrease in the ratios of aminoacyl-tRNAs(Leu)(UUR) versus uncharged tRNAs(Leu)(UUR), and (iii) accurate aminoacylation with leucine without any misacylation. As a marked result, both of the mutant tRNA molecules were deficient in a modification of uridine that occurs in the normal tRNA(Leu)(UUR) at the first position of the anticodon. The lack of this modification may lead to the mistranslation of leucine into non-cognate phenylalanine codons by mutant tRNAs(Leu)(UUR), according to the mitochondrial wobble rule, and/or a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis. This finding could explain why two different mutations (3243 and 3271) manifest indistinguishable clinical features.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

The destabilization of a highly conserved base-pairing (5A-68U) by the m.12201T>C mutation alters structure and function of tRNAHis. Using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a Chinese family into mtDNA-less (ρo) cells, we showed ∼70% decrease in the steady-state level of tRNAHis in mutant cybrids, compared with control cybrids. The mutation changed the conformation of tRNAHis, as suggested by slower electrophoretic mobility of mutated tRNA with respect to the wild-type molecule. However, ∼60% increase in aminoacylated level of tRNAHis was observed in mutant cells. The failure in tRNAHis metabolism was responsible for the variable reductions in seven mtDNA-encoded polypeptides in mutant cells, ranging from 37 to 81%, with the average of ∼46% reduction, as compared with those of control cells. The impaired mitochondrial translation caused defects in respiratory capacity in mutant cells. Furthermore, marked decreases in the levels of mitochondrial ATP and membrane potential were observed in mutant cells.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the m.12201T&gt;C mutation perturbs the tRNAHis structure and function, supported by decreased melting temperature, conformational changes, and instability of mutated tRNA. We show that the m.12201T&gt;C mutation-induced alteration of aminoacylation tRNAHis causes mitochondrial translational defects and respiratory deficiency. We found that the transfer of HARS2 into the cybrids carrying the m.12201T&gt;C mutation raises the levels of aminoacylated tRNAHis from 56.3 to 75.0% but does not change the aminoacylation of other tRNAs. Strikingly, HARS2 overexpression increased the steady-state levels of tRNAHis and of noncognate tRNAs, including tRNAAla, tRNAGln, tRNAGlu, tRNALeu(UUR), tRNALys, and tRNAMet, in cells bearing the m.12201T&gt;C mutation. This improved tRNA metabolism elevated the efficiency of mitochondrial translation, activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, and respiration capacity. Furthermore, HARS2 overexpression markedly increased mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential and reduced production of reactive oxygen species in cells carrying the m.12201T&gt;C mutation.

Aminoacylation was apparently unaffected. On non-denaturating northern blots we detected an altered electrophoretic mobility for G7497A containing tRNA molecules suggesting a structural impact of this mutation, which was confirmed by structural probing. By comparing in vitro transcribed molecules with native RNA in such gels, we also identified tRNA(Ser(UCN)) being present in two isoforms in vivo, probably corresponding to the nascent, unmodified transcripts co-migrating with the in vitro transcripts and a second, faster moving isoform corresponding to the mature tRNA. In cybrids containing either mutations the unmodified isoforms were severely reduced. We hypothesize that both mutations lead to an impairment of post-transcriptional modification processes, ultimately leading to a preponderance of degradation by nucleases over maturation by modifying enzymes, resulting in severely reduced tRNA(Ser(UCN)) steady state levels. We infer that an increased degradation rate, caused by disturbance of tRNA maturation and, in the case of the G7497A mutant, alteration of tRNA structure, is a new pathogenic mechanism of mt tRNA point mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

HNF-4alpha is known to be an essential positive regulator of HNF-1alpha. More recent data demonstrates that HNF-4alpha expression is dependent on HNF-1alpha in mouse pancreatic islets and exocrine cells. This effect is mediated by binding of HNF-1alpha to a tissue-specific promoter (P2) located 45.6 kb upstream from the previously characterized Hnf4alpha promoter (P1). Here we report that the expression of HNF-4alpha in human islets and exocrine cells is primarily mediated by the P2 promoter. Furthermore, we describe a G --> A mutation in a conserved nucleotide position of the HNF-1alpha binding site of the P2 promoter, which cosegregates with MODY. The mutation results in decreased affinity for HNF-1alpha, and consequently in reduced HNF-1alpha-dependent activation.

To date, the mechanisms for the regulation of HNF4A and the dynamic switch of P1-HNF4α and P2-HNF4α during ontogenesis and carcinogenesis are still obscure. Our study validated the previously reported self-stimulation of P1-HNF4α but invalidated the reported synergism between HNF4α and HNF1α. HNF4A-AS1, a long noncoding RNA, is localized between the P2 and P1 promoters of HNF4A. We identified critical roles of P1-HNF4α in regulating the expression of HNF4A-AS1 and its mouse ortholog Hnf4a-os. Paired box 6 (PAX6), a master regulator of pancreas development overexpressed in colon cancer, cooperated with HNF1α to induce P2-HNF4α but antagonized HNF4α in HNF4A-AS1 expression. Thus, PAX6 may be important in determining ontogenic and carcinogenic changes of P2-HNF4α and HNF4A-AS1 in the pancreas and intestine. We also interrogated transactivation activities on multiple gene targets by multiple known and novel HNF4α mutants identified in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1) and liver cancer.

METHODS: Recombineering in Escherichia coli was used to introduce the Tyr437His point mutation into a BAC carrying the full-length human MYOCILIN (MYOC) gene and long flanking regions. This BAC was used to produce transgenic mice. The expression of myocilin in the iridocorneal angle tissues and aqueous humor was studied by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Intraocular pressure was measured noninvasively with a fiber optic transducer. Retinal ganglion cells were retrograde labeled with fluorescent gold, and counted 5 days after labeling.
RESULTS: BAC transgenic mice expressed elevated levels of myocilin in tissues of the iridocorneal angle. Expression of mutated myocilin induced its intracellular accumulation and prevented secretion of both mutated and wild-type myocilin into the aqueous humor. Transgenic mice demonstrated a moderate elevation of intraocular pressure, which was more pronounced at night than in daytime. In the peripheral retina, transgenic mice lost 20% of the retinal ganglion cells and 55% of large retinal ganglion cells. Axonal degeneration was observed at the periphery of the optic nerve.

Four patients were diagnosed through the expanded NBS program with tandem mass spectrometry; one patient was previously diagnosed in a pilot study preceding the NBS implementation. Confirmatory testing consisted of acylcarnitines analysis in dried blood spots, organic acids profiling in urine, genetic analysis of ACADVL gene, and enzyme activity determination in lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Four newborns with specific elevation of acylcarnitines diagnostic for VLCADD and disease-specific acylcarnitines ratios (C14:1, C14, C14:2, C14:1/C2, C14:1/C16) were confirmed with genetic testing: all were compound heterozygotes, two of them had one previously unreported ACDVL gene variant each (NM_000018.3) c.1538C &gt; G; (NP_000009) p.(Ala513Gly) and c.661A &gt; G; p.(Ser221Gly), respectively. In addition, one patient diagnosed in the pilot study also had a specific elevation of acylcarnitines. Subsequent ACDVL genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosity.

23480858,"BACKGROUND: Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency (VLCADD) is diagnosed in the US through newborn screening (NBS). NBS often unequivocally identifies affected individuals, but a growing number of variant patterns can represent mild disease or heterozygous carriers.
AIMS: To evaluate the validity of standard diagnostic procedures for VLCADD by using functional in vitro tools.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 13 patient samples referred to our laboratory because of a suspicion of VLCADD but with some uncertainty to the diagnosis. All 13 patients were suspected of having VLCADD either because of abnormal NBS or suggestive clinical findings. ACADVL genomic DNA sequencing data were available for twelve of them. Ten of the patients had an abnormal NBS suggestive of VLCADD, with three samples showing equivocal results. Three exhibited suggestive clinical findings and blood acylcarnitine profile (two of them had a normal NBS and the third one was unscreened). Assay of VLCAD activity and immunoblotting or immunohistologic staining for VLCAD were performed on fibroblasts. Prokaryotic mutagenesis and expression studies were performed for nine uncharacterized ACADVL missense mutations.
RESULTS: VLCAD activity was abnormal in fibroblast cells from 9 patients (8 identified through abnormal NBS, 1 through clinical symptoms). For these 9 patients, immunoblotting/staining showed the variable presence of VLCAD; all but one had two mutated alleles. Two patients with equivocal NBS results (and a heterozygous genotype) and the two patients with normal NBS exhibited normal VLCAD activity and normal VLCAD protein on immunoblotting/staining thus ruling out VLCAD deficiency. Nine pathogenic missense mutations were characterized with prokaryotic expression studies and showed a decrease in enzyme activity and variable stability of VLCAD antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of functional investigation of abnormal NBS or clinical testing suggestive but not diagnostic of VLCADD. A larger prospective study is necessary to better define the clinical and metabolic ramifications of the defects identified in such patients.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
17186219,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Glucokinase (GCK) acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta cell and regulates insulin secretion. In the gene encoding GCK the heterozygous mutations that result in enzyme inactivation cause MODY2. Functional studies of naturally occurring GCK mutations associated with hyperglycaemia provide further insight into the biochemical basis of glucose sensor regulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification of GCK mutations in selected MODY patients was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing. The kinetic parameters and thermal stability of recombinant mutant human GCK were determined, and in pull-down assays the effect of these mutations on the association of GCK with glucokinase (hexokinase 4) regulator (GCKR, also known as glucokinase regulatory protein [GKRP]) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB1, also known as PFK2) was tested.
RESULTS: We identified three novel GCK mutations: the insertion of an asparagine residue at position 161 (inserN161) and two missense mutations (M235V and R308W). We also identified a fourth mutation (R397L) reported in a previous work. Functional characterisation of these mutations revealed that insertion of asparagine residue N161 fully inactivates GCK, whereas the M235V and R308W mutations only partially impair enzymatic activity. In contrast, GCK kinetics was almost unaffected by the R397L mutation. Although none of these mutations affected the interaction of GCK with PFKFB1, we found that the R308W mutation caused protein instability and increased the strength of interaction with GCKR.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results show that different MODY2 mutations impair GCK function through different mechanisms such as enzymatic activity, protein stability and increased interaction with GCKR, helping further elucidate the regulation of GCK activity.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
31510962,"BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (EC. 3.2.1.20) due to mutations in human GAA gene. The objective of the present study was to examine clinical and molecular characteristics of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) in Thailand.
METHODS: Twelve patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) including 10 Thai and two other Asian ethnicities were enrolled. To examine the molecular characteristics of Pompe patients, GAA gene was analyzed by PCR amplification and direct Sanger-sequencing of 20 exons coding region. The novel mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells for functional verification. The severity of the mutation was rated by study of the GAA enzyme activity detected in transfected cells and culture media, as well as the quantity and quality of the proper sized GAA protein demonstrated by western blot analysis. The GAA three dimensional structures were visualized by PyMol software tool.
RESULTS: All patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, generalized muscle weakness, and undetectable or < 1% of GAA normal activity. Three patients received enzyme replacement therapy with variable outcome depending on the age of the start of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Seventeen pathogenic mutations including four novel variants: c.876C > G (p.Tyr292X), c.1226insG (p.Asp409GlyfsX95), c.1538G > A (p.Asp513Gly), c.1895 T > G (p.Leu632Arg), and a previously reported rare allele of unknown significance: c.781G > A (p.Ala261Thr) were identified. The rating system ranked p.Tyr292X, p. Asp513Gly and p. Leu632Arg as class ""B"" and p. Ala261Thr as class ""D"" or ""E"". These novel mutations were located in the N-terminal beta-sheet domain and the catalytic domain.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides useful information on the mutations of GAA gene in the underrepresented population of Asia which are more diverse than previously described and showing the hotspots in exons 14 and 5, accounting for 62% of mutant alleles. Almost all mutations identified are in class A/B.

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause mild fasting hyperglycemia irrespective of mutation severity due to compensation from the unaffected allele. Conversely, homozygous loss-of-function mutations cause permanent neonatal diabetes requiring lifelong insulin treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between in vitro mutation severity and clinical phenotype in a large international case series of patients with homozygous GCK mutations. Clinical characteristics for 30 patients with diabetes due to homozygous GCK mutations (19 unique mutations, including 16 missense) were compiled and assigned a clinical severity grade (CSG) based on birth weight and age at diagnosis. The majority (28 of 30) of subjects were diagnosed before 9 months, with the remaining two at 9 and 15 years. These are the first two cases of a homozygous GCK mutation diagnosed outside infancy. Recombinant mutant GCK proteins were analyzed for kinetic and thermostability characteristics and assigned a relative activity index (RAI) or relative stability index (RSI) value. Six of 16 missense mutations exhibited severe kinetic defects (RAI ≤ 0.01). There was no correlation between CSG and RAI (r(2) = 0.05, P = 0.39), indicating that kinetics alone did not explain the phenotype. Eighty percent of the remaining mutations showed reduced thermostability, the exceptions being the two later-onset mutations which exhibited increased thermostability. Comparison of CSG with RSI detected a highly significant correlation (r(2) = 0.74, P = 0.002). We report the largest case series of homozygous GCK mutations to date and demonstrate that they can cause childhood-onset diabetes, with protein instability being the major determinant of mutation severity.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
10525657,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations of the glucokinase gene cause hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. A quantitative understanding of these defects of glucose homeostasis linked to the glucokinase gene was lacking. Therefore a database of kinetic variables of wild-type and 20 missense mutants of glucokinase was developed and used in mathematical modelling to predict the thresholds for glucose-stimulated insulin release.
METHODS: Recombinant human glucokinase was generated in E. coli. The k(cat), glucose S(0.5), ATP K(m), and Hill number of glucokinase were determined. Inhibition by Stearoyl CoA and glucokinase regulatory protein and thermal stability were assayed for all mutants kinetically similar to wild-type glucokinase. A mathematical model predicting the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was constructed. This model is based on the two substrate kinetics of glucokinase and the kinetic variables of the database. It is assumed that both glucokinase gene alleles are equally expressed in beta-cells and that induction of glucokinase occurs as a function of basal blood glucose.
RESULTS: Large changes, varying greatly between mutants were found in nearly all variables. Glucokinase flux at threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was about 25 % of total phosphorylating potential in the normal beta-cell and this was used to predict thresholds for the mutant heterozygotes. Clinical data for maturity onset diabetes of the young type linked to the glucokinase gene and familial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia linked to the glucokinase gene and the glucokinase kinetic data of this study were used to test the model. The model predicts fasting blood glucose between 3 and 7 mmol/l in these cases.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: A kinetics database of wild-type and 20 mutants of glucokinase was developed. Many kinetic differences were found for the mutants. The mathematical model to calculate the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release predicts fasting blood glucose between 3 and 7 mmol/l in subjects with glucokinase gene mutations.

23485969,"The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α; also known as NR2A1) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, which have conserved DNA-binding domains and ligand-binding domains. HNF-4α is the most abundant DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40% of the actively transcribed genes have a HNF-4α response element. These regulated genes are largely involved in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism. In the pancreas HNF-4α is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11% of islet genes. HNF-4α protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1 (MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Previous structural analyses of NRs, although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we describe the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4α homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. A convergence zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining domain-domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4α homodimer is different from that of the PPAR-γ-RXR-α heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are assembled on the same DNA element. Our findings suggest that unique quaternary folds and interdomain connections in NRs could be exploited by small-molecule allosteric modulators that affect distal functions in these polypeptides.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
29704611,"Glucokinase (GCK) plays a key role in glucose homeostasis. Heterozygous inactivating mutations in the GCK gene cause the familial, mild fasting hyperglycaemia named MODY2. Besides its particular kinetic characteristics, glucokinase is regulated by subcellular compartmentation in hepatocytes. Glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) binds to GCK, leading to enzyme inhibition and import into the nucleus at fasting. When glucose concentration increases, GCK-GKRP dissociates and GCK is exported to the cytosol due to a nuclear export signal (NES). With the aim to characterize the GCK-NES, we have functionally analysed nine MODY2 mutations located within the NES sequence. Recombinant GCK mutants showed reduced catalytic activity and, in most cases, protein instability. Most of the mutants interact normally with GKRP, although mutations L306R and L309P impair GCK nuclear import in cotransfected cells. We demonstrated that GCK-NES function depends on exportin 1. We further showed that none of the mutations fully inactivate the NES, with the exception of mutation L304P, which likely destabilizes its α-helicoidal structure. Finally, we found that residue Glu300 negatively modulates the NES activity, whereas other residues have the opposite effect, thus suggesting that some of the NES spacer residues contribute to the low affinity of the NES for exportin 1, which is required for its proper functioning. In conclusion, our results have provided functional and structural insights regarding the GCK-NES and contributed to a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of glucokinase. Impairment of this regulatory mechanism by some MODY2 mutations might contribute to the hyperglycaemia in the patients.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the human wild-type islet GK or one of four mutant forms of GK, (the MODY-2 mutants E70K, E300K and V203A and the GK-HI mutant V455M) were transduced into glucose-responsive insulin-secreting beta-HC9 cells and tested functionally in order to initiate the first analysis in vivo of recombinant wild-type and mutant human islet GK. Kinetic analysis of wild-type human GK showed that the glucose S(0. 5) and Hill coefficient were similar to previously published data in vitro (S(0.5) is the glucose level at the half-maximal rate). E70K had half the glucose affinity of wild-type, but similar enzyme activity. V203A demonstrated decreased catalytic activity and an 8-fold increase in glucose S(0.5) when compared with wild-type human islet GK. E300K had a glucose S(0.5) similar to wild-type but a 10-fold reduction in enzyme activity. E300K mRNA levels were comparable with wild-type GK mRNA levels, but Western-blot analyses demonstrated markedly reduced levels of immunologically detectable protein, consistent with an instability mutation. V455M was just as active as wild-type GK, but with a markedly reduced S(0.5). The effects of the different GK mutants on glucose-stimulated insulin release support the kinetic and expression data. These experiments show the utility of a combined genetic, biochemical and cell-biological approach to the quantification of functional and structural changes of human GK that result from MODY-2 and GK-HI mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Members (three generations) of the same family presented either with overt neonatal hyperglycemia, marked postprandial hyperglycemia, or glucosuria. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)) and insulinogenic and disposition indexes were calculated. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results in the GCK mutation carriers from this family were compared with those from other subjects with GCK mutations in the same codon (GCK(261)), with other missense and other types of GCK mutations in different codons from the European MODY Consortium database (GCK(m)).
RESULTS: Mutation G261R was found in the GCK gene. During the OGTT, glucose (P = 0.02) and insulin (P = 0.009) response at 2 h as well as at the 2-h glucose increment (GCK(261) versus other missense GCK mutations, P = 0.003) were significantly higher in GCK(261) than in GCK(m) carriers.

15677479,"Glucokinase (GCK) serves as the pancreatic glucose sensor. Heterozygous inactivating GCK mutations cause hyperglycemia, whereas activating mutations cause hypoglycemia. We studied the GCK V62M mutation identified in two families and co-segregating with hyperglycemia to understand how this mutation resulted in reduced function. Structural modeling locates the mutation close to five naturally occurring activating mutations in the allosteric activator site of the enzyme. Recombinant glutathionyl S-transferase-V62M GCK is paradoxically activated rather than inactivated due to a decreased S0.5 for glucose compared with wild type (4.88 versus 7.55 mM). The recently described pharmacological activator (RO0281675) interacts with GCK at this site. V62M GCK does not respond to RO0281675, nor does it respond to the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). The enzyme is also thermally unstable, but this lability is apparently less pronounced than in the proven instability mutant E300K. Functional and structural analysis of seven amino acid substitutions at residue Val62 has identified a non-linear relationship between activation by the pharmacological activator and the van der Waals interactions energies. Smaller energies allow a hydrophobic interaction between the activator and glucokinase, whereas larger energies prohibit the ligand from fitting into the binding pocket. We conclude that V62M may cause hyperglycemia by a complex defect of GCK regulation involving instability in combination with loss of control by a putative endogenous activator and/or GKRP. This study illustrates that mutations that cause hyperglycemia are not necessarily kinetically inactivating but may exert their effects by other complex mechanisms. Elucidating such mechanisms leads to a deeper understanding of the GCK glucose sensor and the biochemistry of beta-cells and hepatocytes.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We aimed to develop a robust approach for determining the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY and to obtain an accurate estimate of the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY in paediatric cases of diabetes.
METHODS: We extended our previous screening of the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry by 830 additional samples and comprehensively genotyped HNF1A variants in autoantibody-negative participants using next-generation sequencing. Carriers of pathogenic variants were treated by local healthcare providers, and participants with novel likely pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance were enrolled in an investigator-initiated, non-randomised, open-label pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT04239586). To identify variants associated with HNF1A-MODY, we functionally characterised their pathogenicity and assessed the carriers' phenotype and treatment response to sulfonylurea.
RESULTS: In total, 615 autoantibody-negative participants among 4712 cases of paediatric diabetes underwent genetic sequencing, revealing 19 with HNF1A variants. We identified nine carriers with novel variants classified as variants of uncertain significance or likely to be pathogenic, while the remaining ten participants carried five pathogenic variants previously reported. Of the nine carriers with novel variants, six responded favourably to sulfonylurea. Functional investigations revealed their variants to be dysfunctional and demonstrated a correlation with the resulting phenotype, providing evidence for reclassifying these variants as pathogenic.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Based on this robust classification, we estimate that the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY is 0.3% in paediatric diabetes. Clinical phenotyping is challenging and functional investigations provide a strong complementary line of evidence. We demonstrate here that combining clinical phenotyping with functional protein studies provides a powerful tool to obtain a precise diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

In this study, we have characterized a Japanese variant of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, KO, whose platelets express normal amounts of alphaIIb beta3. KO platelets failed to bind the activation-independent ligand-mimetic mAb OP-G2 and did not bind fibrinogen or the activation-dependent ligand-mimetic mAb PAC-1 following activation of alphaIIb beta3 under any condition examined. Sequence analysis of PCR fragments derived from KO platelet mRNA revealed a 6-bp insertion leading to a 2-amino-acid insertion (Arg-Thr) between residues 160 and 161 of the alphaIIb subunit. Introduction of the insertion into wild-type recombinant alphaIIb beta3 expressed in 293 cells led to the normal expression of alphaIIb beta3 having the defect in ligand binding function. The insertion is located within the small loop (Cys146-Cys167) in the third NH2-terminal repeat of the alphaIIb subunit. Alanine substitution of each of the oxygenated residues within the loop (Thr150, Ser152, Glu157, Asp159, Ser161, and Asp163) did not significantly affect expression of alphaIIbbeta3, and only Asp163AlaalphaIIb beta3 abolished the ligand binding function. In addition, Asp163AlaalphaIIb beta3 as well as KO mutant alphaIIb beta3 constitutively expressed the PMI-1 epitope.

METHODS: We analyzed candidate genes -SERPINC1 for AT deficiency, and TNNT2 and LMNA for DCM. In addition, we examined the characteristics of recombinant mutant AT and evaluated the LMNA mutation associated with DCM by molecular modeling.
RESULTS: Genome sequencing of SERPINC1 revealed a C-to-A transversion in exon 6 that resulted in a p.Pro439Thr mutation of AT, which was previously reported as a pleiotropic effect type II AT deficiency (AT Budapest5). However, expression experiments with recombinant 439Thr-AT showed normal heparin affinity, slightly reduced secretion, and low specific activity, which suggested that this mutation exhibits an intermediate feature of type I and type II AT deficiencies. In a survey of gene abnormalities causing DCM, we found no causative gene defect in TNNT2; however, we identified a G-to-C transversion in LMNA that resulted in a novel p.Asp357His mutation in lamin A/C. This acidic-to-basic residue substitution might have impaired the head-to-tail association of two lamin dimers leading to DCM. Further, we identified both SERPINC1 and LMNA mutations in the patient's daughter and son, both of whom had AT deficiency. These data suggested that a p.Pro439Thr mutation in SERPINC1 and a p.Asp357His mutation in LMNA might have cosegregated in this family, associated with AT deficiency and DCM, respectively.

These points are proportional to Log(odds), are additive, and produce a system that recapitulates the Bayesian formulation of the ACMG/AMP guidelines. The strengths of this system are its simplicity and that the connection between point values and odds of pathogenicity allows empirical calibration of the strength of evidence for individual data types. Weaknesses include that a narrow range of prior probabilities is locked in and that the Bayesian nature of the system is inapparent.

METHODS: Here, we evaluated the performance of the mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based functional assay on an extensive set of BRCA2 missense variants.
RESULTS: Whereas all 20 nonpathogenic (class 1/2) variants were able to complement the cell lethal phenotype induced by loss of endogenous mouse Brca2, only 1 out of 15 pathogenic (class 4/5) variants (p.Gly2609Asp) was able to do so. However, in this variant the major tumor suppressive activity of BRCA2, i.e., homology directed repair (HDR), was severely abrogated. Among 43 evaluated VUS (class 3), 7 were unable to complement the lethal phenotype of mouse Brca2 loss while 7 other variants displayed a more severe reduction of HDR activity than observed for class 1/ 2 variants.

In clinical cancer genetics, real-world databases allow for the investigation of prevalence and effectiveness of prevention strategies and targeted treatments and for the identification of barriers to better outcomes. However, real-world data sets have inherent biases and problems (eg, selection bias, incomplete data, measurement error) that may hamper adequate analysis and affect statistical power.
METHODS: Here, we leverage a real-world clinical data set from a large health network for patients with breast cancer tested for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (N = 12,423). We conducted data cleaning and harmonization, cross-referenced with publicly available databases, performed variant reassessment and functional assays, and used functional data to inform a variant's clinical significance applying American College of Medical Geneticists and the Association of Molecular Pathology guidelines.
RESULTS: In the cohort, White and Black patients were over-represented, whereas non-White Hispanic and Asian patients were under-represented. Incorrect or missing variant designations were the most significant contributor to data loss. While manual curation corrected many incorrect designations, a sizable fraction of patient carriers remained with incorrect or missing variant designations.

Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects on DNA repair function or on cancer predisposition, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
30765603,"Genetic testing for BRCA1, a DNA repair protein, can identify carriers of pathogenic variants associated with a substantially increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. However, an association with increased risk is unclear for a large fraction of BRCA1 variants present in the human population. Most of these variants of uncertain clinical significance lead to amino acid changes in the BRCA1 protein. Functional assays are valuable tools to assess the potential pathogenicity of these variants. Here, we systematically probed the effects of substitutions in the C terminus of BRCA1: the N- and C-terminal borders of its tandem BRCT domain, the BRCT-[N-C] linker region, and the α1 and α'1 helices in BRCT-[N] and -[C]. Using a validated transcriptional assay based on a fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the BRCA1 C terminus (amino acids 1396-1863), we assessed the functional impact of 99 missense variants of BRCA1. We include the data obtained for these 99 missense variants in a joint analysis to generate the likelihood of pathogenicity for 347 missense variants in BRCA1 using VarCall, a Bayesian integrative statistical model. The results from this analysis increase our understanding of BRCA1 regions less tolerant to changes, identify functional borders of structural domains, and predict the likelihood of pathogenicity for 98% of all BRCA1 missense variants in this region recorded in the population. This knowledge will be critical for improving risk assessment and clinical treatment of carriers of BRCA1 variants.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

This study used multiple evidence types to assess pathogenicity of 85 variants in/near BRCA2 exon 3. Bioinformatically predicted spliceogenic variants underwent mRNA splicing analysis using minigenes and/or patient samples. ∆E3 was measured using quantitative analysis. A mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) based assay was used to determine the impact of 18 variants on mRNA splicing and protein function. For each variant, population frequency, bioinformatic predictions, clinical data, and existing mRNA splicing and functional results were collated. Variant class was assigned using a gene-specific adaptation of ACMG/AMP guidelines, following a recently proposed points-based system. mRNA and mESC analysis combined identified six variants with transcript and/or functional profiles interpreted as loss of function. Cryptic splice site use for acceptor site variants generated a transcript encoding a shorter protein that retains activity. Overall, 69/85 (81%) variants were classified using the points-based approach. Our analysis shows the value of applying gene-specific ACMG/AMP guidelines using a points-based approach and highlights the consideration of cryptic splice site usage to appropriately assign PVS1 code strength.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,

PTEN is mutated in the germline of both patients with heterogeneous tumor syndromic diseases, categorized as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), and a group affected with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies have unveiled the functional heterogeneity of PTEN variants found in both patient cohorts, making functional studies necessary to provide mechanistic insights related to their pathogenicity. Here, we have functionally characterized a PTEN missense variant [c.49C>G; p.(Gln17Glu); Q17E] associated to both PHTS and ASD patients. The PTEN Q17E variant displayed partially reduced PIP3-catalytic activity and normal stability in cells, as shown using S. cerevisiae and mammalian cell experimental models. Remarkably, PTEN Q17E accumulated in the nucleus, in a process involving the PTEN N-terminal nuclear localization sequence. The analysis of additional germline-associated PTEN N-terminal variants illustrated the existence of a PTEN N-terminal region whose targeting in disease causes PTEN nuclear accumulation, in parallel with defects in PIP3-catalytic activity in cells. Our findings highlight the frequent occurrence of PTEN gene mutations targeting PTEN N-terminus whose pathogenicity may be related, at least in part, with the retention of PTEN in the nucleus. This could be important for the implementation of precision therapies for patients with alterations in the PTEN pathway.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Recently, however, it has been reported that mutations creating splice sites can also cause a range of genetic disorders. In this study, we identified 5656 candidate splice-site-creating mutations (SCMs), of which 3942 are likely to be pathogenic, in 4054 genes responsible for genetic disorders. Reanalysis of exome data obtained from ciliopathy patients led us to identify 38 SCMs as candidate causative mutations. We estimate that, by focusing on SCMs, the increase in diagnosis rate is approximately 5.9-8.5% compared to the number of already known pathogenic variants. This finding suggests that SCMs are mutations worth focusing on in the search for causative mutations of genetic disorders.",PS3_supporting,1,0,,0,

It results from GCK gene mutations that impair enzyme activity. Between 2006 and 2010, we investigated GCK mutations in 66 diabetic children from southern Italy with suspected MODY2. Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) and sequence analysis revealed 19 GCK mutations in 28 children, six of which were novel: p.Glu40Asp, p.Val154Leu, p.Arg447Glyfs, p.Lys458_Cys461del, p.Glu395_Arg397del and c.580-2A>T. We evaluated the effect of these 19 mutations using bioinformatic tools such as Polymorphism Phenotyping (Polyphen), Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) and in silico modelling. We also conducted a functional study to evaluate the pathogenic significance of seven mutations that are among the most severe mutations found in our population, and have never been characterized: p.Glu70Asp, p.His137Asp, p.Phe150Tyr, p.Val154Leu, p.Gly162Asp, p.Arg303Trp and p.Arg392Ser. These seven mutations, by altering one or more kinetic parameters, reduced enzyme catalytic activity by >40%. All mutations except p.Glu70Asp displayed thermal-instability, indeed >50% of enzyme activity was lost at 50°C/30 min. Thus, these seven mutations play a pathogenic role in MODY2 insurgence.

Here, we validated and improved their specificity by performing a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental and clinical data on a model of glucokinase (GCK): 8835 putative variations, including 515 disease-associated variations from 1596 families with diagnoses of monogenic diabetes (GCK-MODY) or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), and 126 variations with available or newly reported (19 variations) data on enzyme kinetics. We also proved that high frequency of disease-associated variations found in patients is closely related to their evolutionary conservation. The default set prediction methods predicted correctly the effects of only a part of the GCK-MODY-associated variations and completely failed to predict the normoglycemic or PHHI-associated variations. Therefore, we calculated evidence-based thresholds that improved significantly the specificity of predictions (≤75%). The combined prediction analysis even allowed to distinguish activating from inactivating variations and identified a group of putatively highly pathogenic variations (EVmutation score <-7.5 and SNAP2 score >70), which were surprisingly underrepresented among MODY patients and thus under negative selection during molecular evolution.

22611063,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the importance of using a combined genetic and functional approach to correctly interpret a genetic test for monogenic diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified three probands with a phenotype consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) subtype GCK-MODY, in whom two potential pathogenic mutations were identified: [R43H/G68D], [E248 K/I225M], or [G261R/D217N]. Allele-specific PCR and cosegregation were used to determine phase. Single and double mutations were kinetically characterized.
RESULTS: The mutations occurred in cis (double mutants) in two probands and in trans in one proband. Functional studies of all double mutants revealed inactivating kinetics. The previously reported GCK-MODY mutations R43H and G68D were inherited from an affected father and unaffected mother, respectively. Both our functional and genetic studies support R43H as the cause of GCK-MODY and G68D as a neutral rare variant.

10486319,"Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) contains 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains characterized by six conserved cysteine residues. Cysteine substitutions that disrupt one of the three disulfide bonds are frequent causes of Marfan syndrome (MFS). We identified 19 new substitutions involving cysteine residues in each of the six positions of EGF-like domains. Allele-specific mRNA assays revealed equal abundance of mutant and normal FBN1 transcripts in all 10 individuals studied. Quantitative pulse-chase analysis of fibrillin protein was performed on 25 mutant fibroblast strains with substitutions of 22 different cysteine residues in 18 different EGF-like domains spanning the entire gene. Normal synthesis and stability of mutant fibrillin molecules was seen in 20/25 individuals, 11 of whom showed delayed intracellular processing and/or secretion. In the remaining five cases, the mutant protein was apparently unstable. In four of these five cases, the second or third disulfide bond of EGF-like domains immediately preceding an 8-cysteine or hybrid domain was affected. All but two mutations caused severe reduction of matrix deposition, which was attributed to a dominant-negative effect of mutant molecules. For genotype/phenotype comparisons, clinical data on 25 probands and 19 mutation-positive family members were analyzed. Ocular manifestations were among the most consistent features (ectopia lentis in 86%, myopia in 80%). Nine mutations encoded by exons 26-32 resulted in early-onset classic MFS and, in one case, neonatal-lethal MFS.

Here we report the whole-exome sequencing of 44 Wilms tumours, identifying missense mutations in the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzymes DROSHA and DICER1, and novel mutations in MYCN, SMARCA4 and ARID1A. Examination of tumour miRNA expression, in vitro processing assays and genomic editing in human cells demonstrates that DICER1 and DROSHA mutations influence miRNA processing through distinct mechanisms. DICER1 RNase IIIB mutations preferentially impair processing of miRNAs deriving from the 5'-arm of pre-miRNA hairpins, while DROSHA RNase IIIB mutations globally inhibit miRNA biogenesis through a dominant-negative mechanism. Both DROSHA and DICER1 mutations impair expression of tumour-suppressing miRNAs, including the let-7 family, important regulators of MYCN, LIN28 and other Wilms tumour oncogenes. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms through which mutations in miRNA biogenesis components reprogramme miRNA expression in human cancer and suggest that these defects define a distinct subclass of Wilms tumours.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
32123317,"PURPOSE: Diagnosis of genetic disorders is hampered by large numbers of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) identified through next-generation sequencing. Many such variants may disrupt normal RNA splicing. We examined effects on splicing of a large cohort of clinically identified variants and compared performance of bioinformatic splicing prediction tools commonly used in diagnostic laboratories.
METHODS: Two hundred fifty-seven variants (coding and noncoding) were referred for analysis across three laboratories. Blood RNA samples underwent targeted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with Sanger sequencing of PCR products and agarose gel electrophoresis. Seventeen samples also underwent transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing with targeted splicing analysis based on Sashimi plot visualization. Bioinformatic splicing predictions were obtained using Alamut, HSF 3.1, and SpliceAI software.
RESULTS: Eighty-five variants (33%) were associated with abnormal splicing. The most frequent abnormality was upstream exon skipping (39/85 variants), which was most often associated with splice donor region variants. SpliceAI had greatest accuracy in predicting splicing abnormalities (0.91) and outperformed other tools in sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Splicing analysis of blood RNA identifies diagnostically important splicing abnormalities and clarifies functional effects of a significant proportion of VUSs. Bioinformatic predictions are improving but still make significant errors. RNA analysis should therefore be routinely considered in genetic disease diagnostics.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
19431183,"To assist in distinguishing disease-causing mutations from nonpathogenic polymorphisms, we developed an objective algorithm to calculate an ""estimate of pathogenic probability"" (EPP) based on the prevalence of a specific variation, its segregation within families, and its predicted effects on protein structure. Eleven missense variations in the RPE65 gene were evaluated in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) using the EPP algorithm. The accuracy of the EPP algorithm was evaluated using a cell-culture assay of RPE65-isomerase activity The variations were engineered into plasmids containing a human RPE65 cDNA and the retinoid isomerase activity of each variant was determined in cultured cells. The EPP algorithm predicted eight substitution mutations to be disease-causing variants. The isomerase catalytic activities of these RPE65 variants were all less than 6% of wild-type. In contrast, the EPP algorithm predicted the other three substitutions to be non-disease-causing, with isomerase activities of 68%, 127%, and 110% of wild-type, respectively. We observed complete concordance between the predicted pathogenicities of missense variations in the RPE65 gene and retinoid isomerase activities measured in a functional assay. These results suggest that the EPP algorithm may be useful to evaluate the pathogenicity of missense variations in other disease genes where functional assays are not available.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16150724,"RPE65 is essential for isomerization of vitamin A to the visual chromophore. Mutations in RPE65 cause early-onset blindness, and Rpe65-deficient mice lack 11-cis-retinal but overaccumulate alltrans-retinyl esters in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RPE65 is proposed to be a substrate chaperone but may have an enzymatic role because it is closely related to carotenoid oxygenases. We hypothesize that, by analogy with other carotenoid oxygenases, the predicted iron-coordinating residues of RPE65 are essential for retinoid isomerization. To clarify RPE65's role in isomerization, we reconstituted a robust minimal visual cycle in 293-F cells. Only cells transfected with RPE65 constructs produced 11-cis-retinoids, but coexpression with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase was needed for high-level production. Accumulation was significant, amounting to >2 nmol of 11-cis-retinol per culture. Transfection with constructs harboring mutations in residues of RPE65 homologous to those required for interlinked enzymatic activity and iron coordination in related enzymes abolish this isomerization. Iron chelation also abolished isomerization activity. Mutating cysteines implicated in palmitoylation of RPE65 had generally little effect on isomerization activity. Mutations associated with Leber congenital amaurosis/early-onset blindness cause partial to total loss of isomerization activity in direct relation to their clinical effects. These findings establish a catalytic role, in conjunction with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, for RPE65 in synthesis of 11-cis-retinol, and its identity as the isomerohydrolase.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

More than 50 ADA mutations are known; most patients are heteroallelic, and most alleles are rare. To analyze the relationship of genotype to phenotype, we quantitated the expression of 29 amino acid sequence-altering alleles in the ADA-deleted Escherichia coli strain SO3834. Expressed ADA activity of wild-type and mutant alleles ranged over five orders of magnitude. The 26 disease-associated alleles expressed 0.001%-0.6% of wild-type activity, versus 5%-28% for 3 alleles from ""partials."" We related these data to the clinical phenotypes and erythrocyte deoxyadenosine nucleotide (dAXP) levels of 52 patients (49 immunodeficient and 3 with partial deficiency) who had 43 genotypes derived from 42 different mutations, including 28 of the expressed alleles. We reduced this complexity to 13 ""genotype categories,"" ranked according to the potential of their constituent alleles to provide ADA activity. Of 31 SCID patients, 28 fell into 3 genotype categories that could express <=0.05% of wild-type ADA activity.

ARTEMIS, a member of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily, shares several features with other family members that act on nucleic acids. ARTEMIS exhibits exonuclease and, in concert with DNA-PKcs, endonuclease activities. To characterize amino acids essential for its catalytic activities, we mutated nine evolutionary conserved histidine and aspartic acid residues within ARTEMIS. Biochemical analyses and a novel in vivo V(D)J recombination assay allowed the identification of eight mutants that were defective in both overhang endonucleolytic and hairpin-opening activities; the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of ARTEMIS, however, was not impaired by these mutations.

METHODS: Abelson virus-transformed Rag2-/- pro-B cells engineered to contain an inverted green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette flanked by recombination signal sequences were transduced with retroviruses encoding either wild-type or 41 naturally occurring RAG2 variants. Bicistronic vectors were used to introduce compound heterozygous RAG2 variants. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells was evaluated by using flow cytometry, and high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze rearrangements at the endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus.
RESULTS: The RAG2 variants showed a wide range of recombination activity. Mutations associated with severe combined immunodeficiency and Omenn syndrome had significantly lower activity than those detected in patients with less severe clinical presentations. Four variants (P253R, F386L, N474S, and M502V) previously thought to be pathogenic were found to have wild-type levels of activity. Use of bicistronic vectors permitted us to assess more carefully the effect of compound heterozygous mutations, with good correlation between GFP expression and the number and diversity of Igh rearrangements.

Patients with ARTEMIS deficiency usually present with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and cellular radiosensitivity, but hypomorphic mutations can cause milder phenotypes (leaky SCID).
OBJECTIVE: We sought to correlate the functional effect of human DCLRE1C mutations on phenotypic presentation in patients with ARTEMIS deficiency.
METHODS: We studied the recombination and DNA repair activity of 41 human DCLRE1C mutations in Dclre1c(-/-) v-abl kinase-transformed pro-B cells retrovirally engineered with a construct that allows quantification of recombination activity by means of flow cytometry. For assessment of DNA repair efficacy, resolution of γH2AX accumulation was studied after ionizing radiation.
RESULTS: Low or absent activity was detected for mutations causing a typical SCID phenotype. Most of the patients with leaky SCID were compound heterozygous for 1 loss-of-function and 1 hypomorphic allele, with significant residual levels of recombination and DNA repair activity. Deletions disrupting the C-terminus result in truncated but partially functional proteins and are often associated with leaky SCID. Overexpression of hypomorphic mutants might improve the functional defect.
CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between the nature and location of DCLRE1C mutations, functional activity, and the clinical phenotype has been observed. Hypomorphic variants that have been reported in the general population can be disease causing if combined in trans with a loss-of-function allele. Therapeutic strategies aimed at inducing overexpression of hypomorphic alleles might be beneficial.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Although some missense mutations have been shown to abolish isomerase activity of RPE65, the molecular bases leading to loss of function and retinal degeneration remain incompletely understood. Here we show that several missense mutations resulted in significant decrease in expression level of RPE65 in the human retinal pigment epithelium cells. The 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13, a newly identified negative regulator of RPE65, mediated degradation of mutant RPE65s, which were misfolded and formed aggregates in the cells. Many mutations, including L22P, T101I, and L408P, were mapped on nonactive sites of RPE65. Enzyme activities of these mutant RPE65s were significantly rescued at low temperature, whereas mutant RPE65s with a distinct active site mutation could not be rescued under the same conditions. 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) displayed a significant synergistic effect on the low temperature-mediated rescue of the mutant RPE65s.

30885608,"Diseases arising from misfolding of SLC6 transporters have been reported over recent years, e.g. folding-deficient mutants of the dopamine transporter and of the glycine transporter-2 cause infantile/juvenile Parkinsonism dystonia and hyperekplexia, respectively. Mutations in the coding sequence of the human creatine transporter-1 (hCRT-1/SLC6A8) gene result in a creatine transporter deficiency syndrome, which varies in its clinical manifestation from epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, development delay and motor dysfunction to gastrointestinal symptoms. Some of the mutations in hCRT-1 occur at residues, which are highly conserved across the SLC6 family. Here, we examined 16 clinically relevant hCRT-1 variants to verify the conjecture that they were misfolded and that this folding defect was amenable to correction. Confocal microscopy imaging revealed that the heterologously expressed YFP-tagged mutant CRTs were trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), co-localised with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin. In contrast, the wild type hCRT-1 reached the plasma membrane. Preincubation of transiently transfected HEK293 cells with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) restored ER export and surface expression of as well as substrate uptake by several folding-deficient CRT-1 mutants. A representative mutant (hCRT-1-P544L) was expressed in rat primary hippocampal neurons to verify pharmacochaperoning in a target cell: 4-PBA promoted the delivery of hCRT-1-P544L to the neurite extensions. These observations show that several folding-deficient hCRT-1 mutants can be rescued. This proof-of-principle justifies the search for additional pharmacochaperones to restore folding of 4PBA-unresponsive hCRT-1 mutants.

This study indicates DHPLC as an important tool in the detection of low-level mosaicism, as does it illustrate the importance of considering somatic and germline mosaicism in the case of apparent de novo mutation.",PS3_supporting,1,0,,0,
24849605,"Over 70 different missense mutations, including a dominant mutation, in RPE65 retinoid isomerase are associated with distinct forms of retinal degeneration; however, the disease mechanisms for most of these mutations have not been studied. Although some mutations have been shown to abolish enzyme activity, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of enzymatic function and retinal degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that the 26 S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (PSMD13), a newly identified negative regulator of RPE65, plays a critical role in regulating pathogenicity of three mutations (L22P, T101I, and L408P) by mediating rapid degradation of mutated RPE65s via a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent non-lysosomal pathway. These mutant RPE65s were misfolded and formed aggregates or high molecular complexes via disulfide bonds. Interaction of PSMD13 with mutant RPE65s promoted degradation of misfolded but not properly folded mutant RPE65s. Many mutations, including L22P, T101I, and L408P, were mapped on non-active sites. Although their activities were very low, these mutant RPE65s were catalytically active and could be significantly rescued at low temperature, whereas mutant RPE65s with a distinct active site mutation could not be rescued under the same conditions. Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and glycerol displayed a significant synergistic effect on the low temperature rescue of the mutant RPE65s by promoting proper folding, reducing aggregation, and increasing membrane association. Our results suggest that a low temperature eye mask and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved oral medicine, may provide a promising ""protein repair therapy"" that can enhance the efficacy of gene therapy by reducing the cytotoxic effect of misfolded mutant RPE65s.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
18599565,"PURPOSE: Later onset and progression of retinal dystrophy occur with some RPE65 missense mutations. The functional consequences of the novel P25L RPE65 mutation was correlated with its early-childhood phenotype and compared with other pathogenic missense mutations.
METHODS: In addition to typical clinical tests, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and two-color threshold perimetry (2CTP) were measured. RPE65 mutations were screened by SSCP and direct sequencing. Isomerase activity of mutant RPE65 was assayed in 293F cells and quantified by HPLC analysis of retinoids.
RESULTS: A very mild phenotype was detected in a now 7-year-old boy homozygous for the P25L mutation in RPE65. Although abnormal dark adaptation was noticed early, best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 at age 5 years and 20/30 at age 7 years. Nystagmus was absent. Cone electroretinogram (ERG) was measurable, rod ERG severely reduced, and FAF very low. 2CTP detected mainly cone-mediated responses in scotopic conditions, and light-adapted cone responses were approximately 1.5 log units below normal. High-resolution spectral domain OCT revealed morphologic changes. Isomerase activity in 293F cells transfected with RPE65/P25L was reduced to 7.7% of wild-type RPE65-transfected cells, whereas RPE65/L22P-transfected cells had 13.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The mild clinical phenotype observed is consistent with the residual activity of a severely hypomorphic mutant RPE65. Reduction to <10% of wild-type RPE65 activity by homozygous P25L correlates with almost complete rod function loss and cone amplitude reduction. Functional survival of cones is possible in patients with residual RPE65 isomerase activity. This patient should profit most from gene therapy.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
32920809,"BACKGROUND:  Hereditary antithrombin deficiency is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder predisposing to recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). To date, only two founder mutations have been described.
OBJECTIVES:  We investigated the antithrombin p.Thr147Ala variant, found in 12 patients of African origin. This variant is known as rs2227606 with minor allele frequency of 0.5% in Africans and absent in Europeans. A possible founder effect was investigated.
METHODS:  Phenotypical characterization was established through immunological and functional methods, both under basal and stress conditions. Recombinant antithrombin molecules were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in HEK-293T cells. Secreted antithrombin was purified and functionally characterized. Structural modeling was performed to predict the impact of the mutation on protein structure. A novel nanopore sequencing approach was used for haplotype investigation.
RESULTS: Ten patients experienced VTE, stroke, or obstetric complications. Antithrombin antigen levels and anti-IIa activity were normal or slightly reduced while anti-Xa activity was reduced with only one commercial assay. On crossed immunoelectrophoresis, an increase of antithrombin fractions with reduced heparin affinity was observed under high ionic strength conditions but not under physiological conditions. The recombinant p.Thr147Ala protein displayed a reduced anti-Xa activity. Structural modeling revealed that residue Thr147 forms three hydrogen bonds that are abolished when mutated to alanine. The investigated patients shared a common haplotype involving 13 SERPINC1 intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms.
CONCLUSION:  Antithrombin p.Thr147Ala, responsible for antithrombin type II heparin binding site deficiency, is the first founder mutation reported in people of African ancestry. This study further emphasizes the limitations of commercial methods to diagnose this specific subtype.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25752820,"RPE65 is a membrane-associated retinoid isomerase involved in the visual cycle responsible for sustaining vision. Many mutations in the human RPE65 gene are associated with distinct forms of retinal degenerative diseases. The pathogenic mechanisms for most of these mutations remain poorly understood. Here, we show that three Leber congenital amaurosis -associated RPE65 mutants (R91W, Y249C and R515W) undergo rapid proteasomal degradation mediated by the 26 S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (PSMD13) in cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. These mutant proteins formed cytosolic inclusion bodies or high molecular weight complexes via disulfide bonds. The mutations are mapped on non-active sites but severely reduced isomerase activity of RPE65. At 30°C, however, the enzymatic function and membrane-association of the mutant RPE65s are significantly rescued possibly due to proper folding. In addition, PSMD13 displayed a drastically decreased effect on degradation of the mutant proteins in the cells grown at 30°C. These results suggest that PSMD13 plays a critical role in regulating pathogenicity of the mutations and the molecular basis for the PSMD13-mediated rapid degradation and loss of function of the mutants is misfolding of RPE65.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
22291974,"Glucokinase (GK) acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta-cell and regulates insulin secretion. Heterozygous mutations in the human GK-encoding GCK gene that reduce the activity index increase the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion threshold and cause familial, mild fasting hyperglycaemia, also known as Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 2 (MODY2). Here we describe the biochemical characterization of five missense GK mutations: p.Ile130Thr, p.Asp205His, p.Gly223Ser, p.His416Arg and p.Ala449Thr. The enzymatic analysis of the corresponding bacterially expressed GST-GK mutant proteins show that all of them impair the kinetic characteristics of the enzyme. In keeping with their position within the protein, mutations p.Ile130Thr, p.Asp205His, p.Gly223Ser, and p.His416Arg strongly decrease the activity index of GK, affecting to one or more kinetic parameters. In contrast, the p.Ala449Thr mutation, which is located in the allosteric activator site, does not affect significantly the activity index of GK, but dramatically modifies the main kinetic parameters responsible for the function of this enzyme as a glucose sensor. The reduced Kcat of the mutant (3.21±0.28 s(-1) vs 47.86±2.78 s(-1)) is balanced by an increased glucose affinity (S(0.5) = 1.33±0.08 mM vs 7.86±0.09 mM) and loss of cooperativity for this substrate. We further studied the mechanism by which this mutation impaired GK kinetics by measuring the differential effects of several competitive inhibitors and one allosteric activator on the mutant protein. Our results suggest that this mutation alters the equilibrium between the conformational states of glucokinase and highlights the importance of the fine-tuning of GK and its role in glucose sensing.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Germline pathogenic variants in DICER1 cause this condition. Detecting a variant of uncertain significance in DICER1 or finding uncommon phenotypes complicate the diagnosis and can negatively impact patient care. We present two unrelated patients suspected to have DICER1 syndrome. Both females (aged 13 and 15 years) presented with multinodular goiter (thyroid follicular nodular disease) and ovarian tumours. One was diagnosed with an ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT) and the other, with an ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumour, later reclassified as a retiform variant of SLCT. Genetic screening showed no germline pathogenic variants in DICER1. However, two potentially splicing variants were found, DICER1 c.5365-4A>G and c.5527+3A>G. Also, typical somatic DICER1 RNase IIIb hotspot mutations were detected in the thyroid and ovarian tissues. In silico splicing algorithms predicted altered splicing for both germline variants and skipping of exon 25 was confirmed by RNA assays for both variants. The reclassification of the ovarian tumour, leading to recognition of the association with DICER1 syndrome and the characterization of the germline intronic variants were all applied to recently described DICER1 variant classification rules. This ultimately resulted in confirmation of DICER1 syndrome in the two teenage girls.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
24292679,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in cancers. PTEN has a central role in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling and converts PIP3 to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane. Despite its importance, the mechanism that mediates membrane localization of PTEN is poorly understood. Here, we generated a library that contains green fluorescent protein fused to randomly mutated human PTEN and expressed the library in Dictyostelium cells. Using live cell imaging, we identified mutations that enhance the association of PTEN with the plasma membrane. These mutations were located in four separate regions, including the phosphatase catalytic site, the calcium-binding region 3 (CBR3) loop, the Cα2 loop and the C-terminal tail phosphorylation site. The phosphatase catalytic site, the CBR3 loop and the Cα2 loop formed the membrane-binding regulatory interface and interacted with the inhibitory phosphorylated C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that membrane recruitment of PTEN is required for PTEN function in cells. Thus, heterologous expression system in Dictyostelium cells provides mechanistic and functional insight into membrane localization of PTEN.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
8630495,We have identified a 15-bp microdeletion in a highly conserved region of the mitochondrially encoded gene for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit III in a patient with severe isolated COX deficiency and recurrent myoglobinuria. The mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) comprised 92% of the mtDNA in muscle and 0.7% in leukocytes. Immunoblots and immunocytochemistry suggested a lack of assembly or instability of the complex. Microdissected muscle fibres revealed significantly higher portions of mutant mtDNA in COX-negative than in COX-positive fibres. This represents the first case of isolated COX deficiency to be defined at the molecular level.,PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
10441567,"We have identified a novel stop-codon mutation in the mtDNA of a young woman with a multisystem mitochondrial disorder. Histochemical analysis of a muscle-biopsy sample showed virtually absent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) stain, and biochemical studies confirmed an isolated reduction of COX activity. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial-encoded COX-subunit genes identified a heteroplasmic G-->A transition at nucleotide position 6930 in the gene for subunit I (COX I). The mutation changes a glycine codon to a stop codon, resulting in a predicted loss of the last 170 amino acids (33%) of the polypeptide. The mutation was present in the patient's muscle, myoblasts, and blood and was not detected in normal or disease controls. It was not detected in mtDNA from leukocytes of the patient's mother, sister, and four maternal aunts. We studied the genetic, biochemical, and morphological characteristics of transmitochondrial cybrid cell lines, obtained by fusing of platelets from the patient with human cells lacking endogenous mtDNA (rho0 cells). There was a direct relationship between the proportion of mutant mtDNA and the biochemical defect. We also observed that the threshold for the phenotypic expression of this mutation was lower than that reported in mutations involving tRNA genes. We suggest that the G6930A mutation causes a disruption in the assembly of the respiratory-chain complex IV.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
11595737,"The mechanisms that regulate oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian cells are largely unknown. To address this issue, cybrids were generated by fusing osteosarcoma cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with platelets from a patient with a stop-codon mutation in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX I). The molecular and biochemical characteristics of cybrids harboring varying levels of mutated mitochondrial DNA were studied. We found a direct correlation between the levels of mutated COX I DNA and mutated COX I mRNA, whereas the levels of COX I total mRNA were unchanged. COX I polypeptide synthesis and steady-state levels were inversely proportional to mutation levels. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II was reduced proportionally to COX I, indicating impairment in complex assembly. COX enzymatic activity was inversely proportional to the levels of mutated mtDNA. However, both cell respiration and ATP synthesis were preserved in cells with lower proportions of mutated genomes, with a threshold at approximately 40%, and decreased linearly with increasing mutated mtDNA. These results indicate that COX levels in mutated cells were not regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. Because of a small excess of COX capacity, the levels of expression of COX subunits exerted a relatively tight control on oxidative phosphorylation.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16690726,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder present in 1 in 8000 people and associated with arteriovenous malformations. Genetic testing can identify individuals at risk of developing the disease and is a useful diagnostic tool.
OBJECTIVE: To present a strategy for mutation detection in families clinically diagnosed with HHT.
METHODS: An optimised strategy for detecting mutations that predispose to HHT is presented. The strategy includes quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction, sequence analysis, RNA analysis, validation of missense mutations by amino acid conservation analysis for the ENG (endoglin) and ACVRL1 (ALK1) genes, and analysis of an ACVRL1 protein structural model. If no causative ENG or ACVRL1 mutation is found, proband samples are referred for sequence analysis of MADH4 (associated with a combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT).
RESULTS: Data obtained over the past eight years were summarised and 16 novel mutations described. Mutations were identified in 155 of 194 families with a confirmed clinical diagnosis (80% sensitivity). Of 155 mutations identified, 94 were in ENG (61%), 58 in ACVRL1 (37%), and three in MADH4 (2%).
CONCLUSIONS: For most missense variants of ENG and ACVRL1 reported to date, study of amino acid conservation showed good concordance between prediction of altered protein function and disease occurrence. The 39 families (20%) yet to be resolved may carry ENG, ACVRL1, or MADH4 mutations too complex or difficult to detect, or mutations in genes yet to be identified.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
22022569,"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition affecting the vascular system and is characterised by epistaxis, arteriovenous malformations and mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal telangiectases. This disorder affects approximately 1 in 8,000 people worldwide. Significant morbidity is associated with this condition in affected individuals, and anaemia can be a consequence of repeated haemorrhages from telangiectasia in the gut and nose. In the majority of the cases reported, the condition is caused by mutations in either ACVRL1 or endoglin genes, which encode components of the TGF-beta signalling pathway. Numerous missense mutations in endoglin have been reported as causative defects for HHT but the exact underlying cellular mechanisms caused by these mutations have not been fully established despite data supporting a role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery. For this reason, we examined the subcellular trafficking of twenty-five endoglin disease-causing missense mutations. The mutant proteins were expressed in HeLa and HEK293 cell lines, and their subcellular localizations were established by confocal fluorescence microscopy alongside the analysis of their N-glycosylation profiles. ER quality control was found to be responsible in eight (L32R, V49F, C53R, V125D, A160D, P165L, I271N and A308D) out of eleven mutants located on the orphan extracellular domain in addition to two (C363Y and C382W) out of thirteen mutants in the Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain. In addition, a single intracellular domain missense mutant was examined and found to traffic predominantly to the plasma membrane. These findings support the notion of the involvement of the ER's quality control in the mechanism of a significant number, but not all, missense endoglin mutants found in HHT type 1 patients. Other mechanisms including loss of interactions with signalling partners as well as adverse effects on functional residues are likely to be the cause of the mutant proteins' loss of function.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

The majority of the patients have a mutation in the coding region of the activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1) or Endoglin (ENG) gene. However, in approximately 15% of cases, sequencing analysis and deletion/duplication testing fail to identify mutations in the coding regions of these genes. Knowing its vital role in transcription and translation control, we were prompted to investigate the 5'untranslated region (UTR) of ENG.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced the 5'UTR of ENG for 154 HHT patients without mutations in ENG or ACVRL1 coding regions. We found a mutation (c.-127C > T), which is predicted to affect translation initiation and alter the reading frame of endoglin. This mutation was found in a family with linkage to the ENG, as well as in three other patients, one of which had an affected sibling with the same mutation. In vitro expression studies showed that a construct with the c.-127C > T mutation alters the translation and decreases the level of the endoglin protein. In addition, a c.-9G > A mutation was found in three patients, one of whom was homozygous for this mutation. Expression studies showed decreased protein levels suggesting that the c.-9G > A is a hypomorphic mutation.

Assessment of complex I assembly by Blue-Native PAGE demonstrated a decrease in fully assembled complex I in the muscle of both cases. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed decreased levels of mtDNA-encoded ND1 and several nuclear encoded complex I subunits in both cases, consistent with functional pathogenic consequences of the identified variants.

The role of RUNX1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is less clear, particularly how germline genetic variation influences the predisposition to this type of leukemia. Sequencing 4,836 children with B-ALL and 1,354 cases of T-ALL, we identified 31 and 18 germline RUNX1 variants, respectively. RUNX1 variants in B-ALL consistently showed minimal damaging effects. By contrast, 6 T-ALL-related variants result in drastic loss of RUNX1 activity as a transcription activator in vitro. Ectopic expression of dominant-negative RUNX1 variants in human CD34+ cells repressed differentiation into erythroid, megakaryocytes, and T cells, while promoting myeloid cell development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of T-ALL models showed distinctive patterns of RUNX1 binding by variant proteins. Further whole genome sequencing identified JAK3 mutation as the most frequent somatic genomic abnormality in T-ALL with germline RUNX1 variants. Co-introduction of RUNX1 variant and JAK3 mutation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice gave rise to T-ALL with early T-cell precursor phenotype.

Loss or reduction in the function of pendrin results in both syndromic (Pendred syndrome) and non-syndromic (non-syndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (ns-EVA)) hearing loss. Factors inducing an up-regulation of pendrin in the kidney and the lung may have an impact on the pathogenesis of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Here we characterize the ion transport activity of wild-type (WT) pendrin and seven of its allelic variants selected among those reported in the single nucleotide polymorphisms data base (dbSNPs), some of which were previously identified in a cohort of individuals with normal hearing or deaf patients belonging to the Spanish population.
METHODS: WT and mutated pendrin allelic variants were functionally characterized in a heterologous over-expression system by means of fluorometric methods evaluating the I(-)/Cl(-) and Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange and an assay evaluating the efflux of radiolabeled iodide.
RESULTS: The transport activity of pendrin P70L, P301L and F667C is completely abolished; pendrin V609G and D687Y allelic variants are functionally impaired but retain significant transport. Pendrin F354S activity is indistinguishable from WT, while pendrin V88I and G740S exhibit a gain of function.

22745121,"Previously, we showed that mutating RPE65 residue Phe-103 preferentially produces 13-cis-retinol instead of 11-cis-retinol, supporting a carbocation/radical cation mechanism of retinol isomerization. We asked whether this modulation of specificity can occur with residues other than Phe-103 and what role it plays in substrate binding and isomerization. We modeled the substrate-binding cleft of RPE65 to identify residues lining its surface. Many are phenylalanines and tyrosines, including three Phe residues (Phe-61, Phe-312, and Phe-526) forming an arch-like arrangement astride the cleft and Tyr-338. Also, Phe-418 sits at the neck of the cleft, lending a bend to the volume enclosed by the cleft. All mutations of Phe-61, Phe-312, and Phe-418 result in severely impaired or inactive enzyme. However, mutation of Phe-526 and Tyr-338, like Phe-103, decreases 11-cis-retinol formation, whereas increasing the 13-cis isomer. Significantly, 2 of these 3 residues, Phe-103 and Tyr-338, are located on putatively mobile interstrand loops. We propose that residual densities located in the binding cleft of the RPE65 structure represents a post-cleavage snapshot consistent not only with a fatty acid product, as originally modeled, but also an 11-cis-retinol product. Substrate docking simulations permit 11-cis- or 13-cis-retinyl ester binding in this relatively closed cleft, with the latter favored in F103L, F526A, and Y338A mutant structures, but prohibit binding of all-trans-retinyl ester, suggesting that isomerization occurs early in the temporal sequence, with O-alkyl ester cleavage occurring later.

To determine the biological activities of these mutants, we performed functional assays testing their abilities to transduce BMP signals. We found that the reported missense mutations within the extracellular and kinase domains of BMPR-II abrogated their signal-transducing abilities. BMPR-II proteins containing mutations at the conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular and kinase domains were detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the loss of signaling ability of certain BMPR-II mutants is due at least in part to their altered subcellular localization. In contrast, BMPR-II mutants with truncation of the cytoplasmic tail retained the ability to transduce BMP signals. The differences in biological activities among the BMPR-II mutants observed thus suggest that additional genetic and/or environmental factors may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of PPH.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

METHODS: We enrolled five DEE patients with five de novo variants of the SCN2A. Functional analysis and pharmacological features of Nav1.2 channel protein expressed in HEK293T cells were characterized by whole-cell patch-clamp recording.
RESULTS: The phenotypes of c.4712T>C(p. I1571T), c.2995G>A(p.E999K), and c.4015A>G(p. N1339D) variants showed similar characteristics, including early seizure onset with severe to profound intellectual disability. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of the activation curve and smaller recovery time constants of fast-inactivation than in wild type, indicating a prominent gain of function (GOF). Moreover, pharmacological electrophysiology showed that phenytoin inhibited over a 70% peak current and was more effective than oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine. In contrast, c.4972C>T (p.P1658S) and c.5317G>A (p.A1773T) led to loss of function (LOF) changes, showing reduced current density and enhanced fast inactivation.

Mutations in the genes SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN8A, encoding the Na+ channel pore-forming (α) subunits Nav1.1, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively, and SCN1B, encoding the accessory subunit β<sub>1</sub> , are established causes of genetic epilepsies. SCN3A, encoding Nav1.3, is known to be highly expressed in brain, but has not previously been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we describe a cohort of 4 patients with epileptic encephalopathy and heterozygous de novo missense variants in SCN3A (p.Ile875Thr in 2 cases, p.Pro1333Leu, and p.Val1769Ala).
METHODS: All patients presented with treatment-resistant epilepsy in the first year of life, severe to profound intellectual disability, and in 2 cases (both with the variant p.Ile875Thr), diffuse polymicrogyria.
RESULTS: Electrophysiological recordings of mutant channels revealed prominent gain of channel function, with a markedly increased amplitude of the slowly inactivating current component, and for 2 of 3 mutants (p.Ile875Thr and p.Pro1333Leu), a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Gain of function was not observed for Nav1.3 variants known or presumed to be inherited (p.Arg1642Cys and p.Lys1799Gln). The antiseizure medications phenytoin and lacosamide selectively blocked slowly inactivating over transient current in wild-type and mutant Nav1.3 channels.
INTERPRETATION: These findings establish SCN3A as a new gene for infantile epileptic encephalopathy and suggest a potential pharmacologic intervention. These findings also reinforce the role of Nav1.3 as an important regulator of neuronal excitability in the developing brain, while providing additional insight into mechanisms of slow inactivation of Nav1.3.

We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations.

Among them, 88 underwent genetic testing, and 47 children (53.4%) were identified as having pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants: 39 had single gene mutations (83.0%, 39/47), and eight had copy number variants (17.0%, 8/47), with SCN1A (14.9%, 7/47) and MECP2 (10.6%, 5/47) gene mutations being the most common. Mutations in other genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels including SCN2A, CACNA1A, CACNA1H, CACNA1D, and KCNQ2 were also common, but the number of individual cases for each gene was small. Epilepsy syndrome and epilepsy-associated syndrome were more common (P = 0.014), and higher rates of poly-therapy (P = 0.01) were used in the positive genetic test group than in the negative group. There were no statistically significant differences in drug-refractory epilepsy, ASD severity, or intellectual disability between the positive genetic test group and the negative genetic group. These data strongly indicate the need for ASD screening in children with epilepsy with voltage-gated ion channel gene variants for better diagnosis and early intervention.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
32655540,"Background: Variants in recombination-activating genes (RAG) are common genetic causes of autosomal recessive forms of combined immunodeficiencies (CID) ranging from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Omenn syndrome (OS), leaky SCID, and CID with granulomas and/or autoimmunity (CID-G/AI), and even milder presentation with antibody deficiency. Objective: We aim to estimate the incidence, clinical presentation, genetic variability, and treatment outcome with geographic distribution of patients with the RAG defects in populations inhabiting South, West, and East Slavic countries. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from RAG-deficient patients of Slavic origin via chart review, retrospectively. Recombinase activity was determined in vitro by flow cytometry-based assay. Results: Based on the clinical and immunologic phenotype, our cohort of 82 patients from 68 families represented a wide spectrum of RAG deficiencies, including SCID (n = 20), OS (n = 37), and LS/CID (n = 25) phenotypes. Sixty-seven (81.7%) patients carried RAG1 and 15 patients (18.3%) carried RAG2 biallelic variants. We estimate that the minimal annual incidence of RAG deficiency in Slavic countries varies between 1 in 180,000 and 1 in 300,000 live births, and it may vary secondary to health care disparities in these regions. In our cohort, 70% (n = 47) of patients with RAG1 variants carried p.K86Vfs*33 (c.256_257delAA) allele, either in homozygous (n = 18, 27%) or in compound heterozygous (n = 29, 43%) form. The majority (77%) of patients with homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 variant originated from Vistula watershed area in Central and Eastern Poland, and compound heterozygote cases were distributed among all Slavic countries except Bulgaria. Clinical and immunological presentation of homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 cases was highly diverse (SCID, OS, and AS/CID) suggestive of strong influence of additional genetic and/or epigenetic factors in shaping the final phenotype. Conclusion: We propose that RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 is a founder variant originating from the Vistula watershed region in Poland, which may explain a high proportion of homozygous cases from Central and Eastern Poland and the presence of the variant in all Slavs. Our studies in this cohort of RAG1 founder variants confirm that clinical and immunological phenotypes only partially depend on the underlying genetic defect. As access to HSCT is improving among RAG-deficient patients in Eastern Europe, we anticipate improvements in survival.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
15611064,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product, pVHL, targets the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-alpha) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This tumor suppressor function is mediated by the alpha- and beta-domains responsible for assembling the pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and for recognizing the prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-alpha, respectively. The molecular basis for a large number of tumor-derived mutations can be attributed to alterations that directly compromise the ability of pVHL to assemble the E3 or to contact the substrate. Here we describe a new mechanism of oncogenic inactivation by VHL missense mutations that lie in the L1 and L7 linker regions distal to the HIF-alpha-binding pocket. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tumorigenic L1 loop mutation of Ser(65) to Leu, deficient in promoting the degradation of HIF-alpha, disrupts the coordination of internal motions of the pVHL.HIF-1alpha complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to S65L, five other tumor-derived VHL mutations located within the L1 loop are each defective in mediating proteolysis of HIF-2alpha. Moreover, dynamic organization of pVHL.HIF-1alpha recognition is focally centered on Gln(145) within the L7 loop, and its tumorigenic mutant Q145H abolishes almost all of the correlated dynamic motions. Intriguingly, Q145H, whereas defective in targeting cellular HIF-alpha for degradation, had an attenuated hydroxylation dependence in binding to HIF-1alpha in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that specific association between pVHL and the hydroxylated HIF-alpha requires both the L1 and L7 loops to coordinate dynamic coupling among distant pVHL regions, whose mutational disruption inactivates VHL and is hence responsible for tumorigenesis.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
30890701,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the major cause of death among patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis opens the question about the underlying mechanisms. Previously we have described that RWDD3 or RSUME (RWD domain-containing protein SUMO Enhancer) sumoylates and binds VHL protein and negatively regulates HIF degradation, leading to xenograft RCC tumor growth in mice. In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis in a ccRCC dataset showing an association of RSUME levels with VHL mutations and tumor progression, and we demonstrate the molecular mechanism by which RSUME regulates the pathologic angiogenic phenotype of VHL missense mutations. We report that VHL mutants fail to downregulate RSUME protein levels accounting for the increased RSUME expression found in RCC tumors. Furthermore, we prove that targeting RSUME in RCC cell line clones carrying missense VHL mutants results in decreased early tumor angiogenesis. The mechanism we describe is that RSUME sumoylates VHL mutants and beyond its sumoylation capacity, interacts with Type 2 VHL mutants, reduces HIF-2α-VHL mutants binding, and negatively regulates the assembly of the Type 2 VHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV) complex. Altogether these results show RSUME involvement in VHL mutants deregulation that leads to the angiogenic phenotype of RCC tumors.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
12944410,"Bi-allelic-inactivating mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene are found in the majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (VHL(-/-) RCC). VHL(-/-) RCC cells overproduce hypoxia-inducible genes as a consequence of constitutive, oxygen-independent activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). While HIF activation explains the highly vascularized nature of VHL loss lesions, the relative role of HIF in oncogenesis and loss of growth control remains unknown. Here, we report that HIF plays a central role in promoting unregulated growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells by activating the transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway. Dominant-negative HIF and enzymatic inhibition of EGF-R were equally efficient at abolishing EGF-R activation and serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. TGF-alpha is the only known EGF-R ligand that has a VHL-dependent expression profile and its overexpression by VHL(-/-) RCC cells is a direct consequence of HIF activation. In contrast to TGF-alpha, other HIF targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were unable to stimulate serum-independent growth of VHL(-/-) RCC cells. VHL(-/-) RCC cells expressing reintroduced type 2C mutants of VHL, and which retain the ability to degrade HIF, fail to overproduce TGF-alpha and proliferate in serum-free media. These data link HIF with the overproduction of a bona fide renal cell mitogen leading to activation of a pathway involved in growth of renal cancer cells. Moreover, our results suggest that HIF might be involved in oncogenesis to a much higher extent than previously appreciated.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
19030229,"BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by a spectrum of hypervascular tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, which occur with VHL genotype-specific differences in penetrance. VHL loss causes a failure to regulate the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), resulting in accumulation of both factors to high levels. Although HIF dysregulation is critical to VHL disease-associated renal tumorigenesis, increasing evidence points toward gradations of HIF dysregulation contributing to the degree of predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other manifestations of the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This investigation examined the ability of disease-specific VHL missense mutations to support the assembly of the VBC complex and to promote the ubiquitylation of HIF. Our interaction analysis supported previous observations that VHL Type 2B mutations disrupt the interaction between pVHL and Elongin C but maintain partial regulation of HIF. We additionally demonstrated that Type 2B mutant pVHL forms a remnant VBC complex containing the active members ROC1 and Cullin-2 which retains the ability to ubiquitylate HIF-1alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that subtypes of VHL mutations support an intermediate level of HIF regulation via a remnant VBC complex. These findings provide a mechanism for the graded HIF dysregulation and genetic predisposition for cancer development in VHL disease.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
19228690,"pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein) is the substrate recognition subunit of the CBC(VHL) ubiquitin ligase complex promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor subunits, HIF-1/2alpha. Mutational inactivation of pVHL causes the hereditary von Hippel-Lindau tumor syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. Whereas the development of hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinomas has been attributed to impaired HIF-1/2alpha down-regulation by pVHL mutant proteins, the molecular defects underlying the development of pheochromocytomas are still unknown. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of pVHL mutant proteins linked to type 2C (pheochromocytoma only) von Hippel-Lindau disease. Type 2C-associated mutations caused extensive structural perturbations of pVHL, as revealed by the reduced stability, increased proteolytic susceptibility, and dramatically altered NMR spectrum of recombinant, mutant pVHL-ElonginC-ElonginB complexes in vitro. In human cell lines, type 2C-linked mutations destabilized the CBC(VHL) ubiquitin ligase complex and resulted in reduced cellular pVHL levels. Together, our data reveal unexpectedly strong structural defects of type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins that are likely to affect both HIF-1/2alpha-related and -unrelated pVHL functions in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
23772956,"BACKGROUND: In von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene cause clear cell renal carcinomas, hemangioblastomas, and pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene product is part of an ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) is a key substrate, although additional VHL functions have been described. A genotype-phenotype relationship exists in VHL disease such that specific VHL mutations elicit certain subsets of these tumors. Here, we examine VHL genotype-phenotype correlations at the cellular level, focusing on the regulation of tight junctions and cell morphology.
METHODS: Wild-type and various mutant VHL proteins representing VHL disease subtypes were stably expressed in 3 VHL-negative renal carcinoma cell lines. Using these cell lines, the roles of various VHL-associated cellular functions in regulation of cell morphology were investigated.
RESULTS: As a whole, type 1 mutants varied greatly from type 2 mutants, demonstrating high levels of HIF-2alpha, cyclin D1 and alpha5 integrin, lower p27 levels, and a spindly, fibroblastic cellular appearance. Type 2 mutations demonstrated an epithelial morphology similar to wild-type VHL in the majority of the renal cell lines used. Knockdown of p27 in cells with wild-type VHL led to perturbations of both epithelial morphology and ZO-1 localization to tight junctions. ZO-1 localization correlated well with VHL disease subtypes, with greater mislocalization observed for genotypes associated with a higher risk of renal carcinoma. HIF-2alpha knockdown in 786-O partially restored ZO-1 localization, but did not restore an epithelial morphology.
CONCLUSION: VHL has both HIF-alpha dependent and HIF-alpha independent functions in regulating tight junctions and cell morphology that likely impact the clinical phenotypes seen in VHL disease.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
31337753,"Duplication of ancestral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)α coincided with the evolution of vertebrate species. Paralogs HIF1α and HIF2α are the most well-known factors for modulating the cellular transcriptional profile following hypoxia. However, how the processes of natural selection acted upon the coding region of these two genes to optimize the cellular response to hypoxia during evolution remains unclear. A key negative regulator of HIFα is von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein. Here we show that evolutionarily-relevant substitutions can modulate a secondary contact between HIF1α Met561 and VHL Phe91. Notably, HIF1α binds more tightly than HIF2α to VHL due to a conserved Met to Thr substitution observed in the vertebrate lineage. Similarly, substitution of VHL Phe91 with Tyr, as seen in invertebrate species, decreases VHL affinity for both HIF1α and HIF2α. We propose that vertebrate evolution involved a more complex hypoxia response with fine-tuned divergence of VHL affinity for HIF1α and HIF2α.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
32766856,"Many mutations in the signal peptide and propeptide of factor IX (FIX) cause hemophilia B. A FIX variants database reports 28 unique missense mutations in these regions that lead to FIX deficiency, but the underlying mechanism is known only for the mutations on R43 that interfere with propeptide cleavage. It remains unclear how other mutations result in FIX deficiency and why patients carrying the same mutation have different bleeding tendencies. Here, we modify a cell-based reporter assay to characterize the missense mutations in the signal peptide and propeptide of FIX. The results show that the level of secreted conformation-specific reporter (SCSR), which has a functional γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domain of FIX, decreases significantly in most mutations. The decreased SCSR level is consistent with FIX deficiency in hemophilia B patients. Moreover, we find that the decrease in the SCSR level is caused by several distinct mechanisms, including interfering with cotranslational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, protein secretion, γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain, and cleavage of the signal peptide or propeptide. Importantly, our results also show that the SCSR levels of most signal peptide and propeptide mutations increase with vitamin K concentration, suggesting that the heterogeneity of bleeding tendencies may be related to vitamin K levels in the body. Thus, oral administration of vitamin K may alleviate the severity of bleeding tendencies in patients with missense mutations in the FIX signal peptide and propeptide regions.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
28729369,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The rare mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant m.8340G>A has been previously reported in the literature in a single, sporadic case of mitochondrial myopathy. In this report, we aim to investigate the case of a 39-year-old male patient with sensorineural deafness who presented to the eye clinic with nyctalopia, retinal pigmentary changes and bilateral cortical cataracts.
METHODS: The patient was examined clinically and investigated with autofluorescence, full-field electroretinography, electro-oculogram and dark adaptometry. Sequencing of the mitochondrial genome in blood and muscle tissue was followed by histochemical and biochemical analyses together with single fibre studies of a muscle biopsy to confirm a mitochondrial aetiology.
RESULTS: Electrophysiology, colour testing and dark adaptometry showed significant photoreceptor dysfunction with macular involvement. Sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome revealed a rare mitochondrial tRNALys (MTTK) gene variant-m.8340G&gt;A-which was heteroplasmic in blood (11%) and skeletal muscle (65%) and cosegregated with cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres in single-fibre studies.
CONCLUSION: We confirm the pathogenicity of the rare mitochondrial m.8340G>A variant the basis of single-fibre segregation studies and its association with an expanded clinical phenotype. Our case expands the phenotypic spectrum of diseases associated with mitochondrial tRNA point mutations, highlighting the importance of considering a mitochondrial diagnosis in similar cases presenting to the eye clinic and the importance of further genetic testing if standard mutational analysis does not yield a result.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
8132749,"We studied the physiometabolic effects of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmic point mutation, the A-->G3260 transition associated with maternally inherited myopathy and cardiomyopathy. To eliminate the possible influence of the autochthonous nuclear gene set, we fused myoblast-derived cytoplasts of a patient with a human tumoral cell line deprived of mtDNA (Rho degrees). The presence and amount of the mutant G3260 vs the wild-type A3260 were measured by solid phase minisequencing. We observed a marked reduction of the percentage of mutant mtDNA in the culture system compared with that measured in the donor's muscle biopsy, suggesting the presence of negative selection against the mutation. Furthermore, stable mitotic segregation of the two mtDNA populations was observed in 18 of 19 transformant clones, suggesting the presence of intraorganelle and possibly intracellular homoplasmy in the precursor cells of the donor. Several indexes of mtDNA-related respiratory capacity, including oxygen consumption, complex I- and complex IV-specific activities, and lactate production, were markedly abnormal in the clones containing a high proportion of mutant mtDNA, as compared with those containing homoplasmic wild-type mtDNA, possibly because of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis. We conclude that (a) the A-->G3260 transition is indeed responsible for the mitochondrial disorder identified in the donor patient, and (b) transformant cybrid system gives direct evidence of the mitochondrial origin of a genetic disorder and should be adopted for the evaluation of the pathogenic potential of the mtDNA mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16754667,"RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the retinoid visual cycle essential for recycling of 11-cis retinal, the chromophore for visual pigments in both rod and cone photoreceptors. Mutations in the RPE65 gene are associated with inherited retinal dystrophies with unknown mechanisms. Here we show that two point mutations of RPE65, R91W and Y368H, identified in patients with retinal dystrophies both abolished the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65 after a subretinal injection into the Rpe65-/- mice and in the in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay, independent of their protein levels. Further, the R91W and Y368H mutants showed significantly decreased protein levels but unchanged mRNA levels when compared with the wild-type RPE65 (wtRPE65). Protein stability analysis showed that wtRPE65 is a fairly stable protein, with an apparent half-life longer than 10 h, when expressed in 293A cells. Under the same conditions, mutants R91W and Y368H both showed substantially decreased protein stabilities, with half-lives less than 2 and 6 h, respectively. Subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis demonstrated that wtRPE65 predominantly exists in the membrane fraction, while both of the mutants are primarily distributed in the cytosolic fraction, suggesting that these mutations disrupt the membrane association of RPE65. However, palmitoylation assay showed that wtRPE65 and both of the mutants were palmitoylated. These results suggest that these mutations may result in critical structural alterations of RPE65 protein, disrupt its membrane association, and consequently impair its isomerohydrolase activity, leading to retinal degeneration.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
11047755,"We have reinvestigated a young woman, originally reported by us in 1983, who presented with exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis associated with severe deficiency of complex III and who responded to therapy with menadione and ascorbate. Gradually, she developed symptoms of a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Immunocytochemistry of serial sections of muscle showed a mosaic of fibers that reacted poorly with antibodies to subunits of complex III but reacted normally with antibodies to subunits of complexes I, II, or IV, suggesting a mutation of mtDNA. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic value of immunocytochemistry in identifying specific respiratory-chain deficiencies and, potentially, distinguishing between nuclear- or mtDNA-encoded defects. Sequence analysis revealed a stop-codon mutation (G15242A) in the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome b gene, resulting in loss of the last 215 amino acids of cytochrome b. PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that the G15242A mutation was heteroplasmic and was present in a high percentage (87%) of affected tissue (skeletal muscle) and a low percentage (0.7%) of unaffected tissue (blood) but was not detected in controls. Analysis of microdissected muscle fibers showed a significant correlation between the immunoreactivity toward the Rieske protein of complex III and the percentage of mutant mtDNA: immunopositive fibers had a median value of 33% of the G15242A mutation, whereas immunonegative, ragged-red fibers had a median value of 89%, indicating that the stop-codon mutation was pathogenic in this patient. The G15242A mutation was also present in several other tissues, including hair roots, indicating that it must have arisen either very early in embryogenesis, before separation of the primary germ layers, or in the maternal germ line.

We used matched exome and transcriptome data from 9,769 human tumors to systematically elucidate the rules of NMD targeting in human cells. An integrated model incorporating multiple rules beyond the canonical EJC model explains approximately three-fourths of the non-random variance in NMD efficiency across thousands of PTCs.

37419334,"BACKGROUND: Thymus hypoplasia due to stromal cell problems has been linked to mutations in several transcription factors, including Forkhead box N1 (FOXN1). FOXN1 supports T-cell development by regulating the formation and expansion of thymic epithelial cells (TECs). While autosomal recessive FOXN1 mutations result in a nude and severe combined immunodeficiency phenotype, the impact of single-allelic or compound heterozygous FOXN1 mutations is less well-defined.
OBJECTIVE: With more than 400 FOXN1 mutations reported, their impact on protein function and thymopoiesis remains unclear for most variants. We developed a systematic approach to delineate the functional impact of diverse FOXN1 variants.
METHODS: Selected FOXN1 variants were tested with transcriptional reporter assays and imaging studies. Thymopoiesis was assessed in mouse lines genocopying several human FOXN1 variants. Reaggregate thymus organ cultures were used to compare the thymopoietic potential of the FOXN1 variants.
RESULTS: FOXN1 variants were categorized into benign, loss- or gain-of-function, and/or dominant-negatives. Dominant negative activities mapped to frameshift variants impacting the transactivation domain. A nuclear localization signal was mapped within the DNA binding domain. Thymopoiesis analyses with mouse models and reaggregate thymus organ cultures revealed distinct consequences of particular Foxn1 variants on T-cell development.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential effect of a FOXN1 variant on T-cell output from the thymus may relate to its effects on transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and/or dominant negative functions. A combination of functional assays and thymopoiesis comparisons enabled a categorization of diverse FOXN1 variants and their potential impact on T-cell output from the thymus.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

To understand the basis of this phenotype and the effects of the mutations on FOXN1, we generated mice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to genocopy mutations in 1 of the patients. The mice with the Foxn1 compound heterozygous mutations had thymic hypoplasia, causing a T-B+NK+ SCID phenotype, whereas the hair and nails of these mice were normal. Characterization of the functional changes due to the Foxn1 mutations revealed a 5-amino acid segment at the end of the DNA-binding domain essential for the development of TECs but not keratinocytes. The transcriptional activity of this Foxn1 mutant was partly retained, indicating a region that specifies TEC functions.

Pyrosequencing confirmed mtDNA heteroplasmy for both mutations (m.5631G>A and m.5610G>A) whilst single-muscle fibre segregation studies (revealing statistically significant higher mutation loads in COX-deficient fibres than in COX-positive fibres), hierarchical mutation segregation within patient tissues and decreased steady-state mt-tRNA(Ala) levels all provide compelling evidence of pathogenicity. Interestingly, both patients showed very high-mutation levels in all tissues, inferring that the threshold for impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, as evidenced by COX deficiency, appears to be extremely high for these mt-tRNA(Ala) variants.

We detected a novel heteroplasmic C>T mutation at nucleotide 5545 of mtDNA, which was present at unusually low levels (<25%) in affected tissues. The pathogenic threshold for the mutation in cybrids was between 4 and 8%, implying a dominant mechanism of action. The mutation affects the central base of the anticodon triplet of tRNA(Trp) and it may alter the codon specificity of the affected tRNA. These findings introduce the concept of dominance in mitochondrial genetics and pose new diagnostic challenges, because such mutations may easily escape detection.

All mutations resulted in reduced secretion of VWF in the medium and in intracellular retention. The amino-terminal mutants C1130F and C1149R showed impaired multimerization by lacking high molecular weight (HMW) multimers, in cotransfection experiments with wild-type (wt) VWF, the multimeric pattern was consistent with the pattern in the heterozygous type 1 patients.

The multimeric pattern of C2739Y and C2754W is characterized by the absence of HMW multimers, an excess of monomers and intervening odd-numbered multimeric bands, indicating a dimerization defect. The carboxy-terminal mutant C2671Y is different, with mildly reduced secretion, intermediate intracellular retention and a normal multimerization pattern.

SUMMARY: Background Treatment of the bleeding disorder von Willebrand disease (VWD) focuses on increasing von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels by administration of desmopressin or VWF-containing concentrates. Both therapies leave the production of mutant VWF unhindered, which may have additional consequences, such as thrombocytopenia in patients with VWD type 2B, competition between mutant and normal VWF for platelet receptors, and the potential development of intestinal angiodysplasia. Most cases of VWD are caused by dominant-negative mutations in VWF, and we hypothesize that diminishing expression of mutant VWF positively affects VWD phenotypes. Objectives To investigate allele-specific inhibition of VWF by applying small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VWF. This approach allows allele-specific knockdown irrespective of the mutations causing VWD. Methods Four SNPs with a high predicted heterozygosity within VWF were selected, and siRNAs were designed against both alleles of the four SNPs. siRNA efficiency, allele specificity and siRNA-mediated phenotypic improvements were determined in VWF-expressing HEK293 cells. Results Twelve siRNAs were able to efficiently inhibit single VWF alleles in HEK293 cells that stably produce VWF. Transient cotransfections of these siRNAs with two VWF alleles resulted in a clear preference for the targeted allele over the untargeted allele for 11 siRNAs. We also demonstrated siRNA-mediated phenotypic improvement of the VWF multimerization pattern of the VWD type 2A mutation VWF p.Cys2773Ser. Conclusions Allele-specific siRNAs are able to distinguish VWF alleles on the basis of one nucleotide variation, and are able to improve a severe multimerization defect caused by VWF p.Cys2773Ser. This holds promise for the therapeutic application of allele-specific siRNAs in dominant-negative VWD.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
28581694,"UNLABELLED: Essentials Type 2N von Willebrand disease involves impaired von Willebrand factor to factor VIII binding. Type 2N von Willebrand disease mutations exhibit qualitative and mild quantitative deficiencies. Type 2N von Willebrand disease mice exhibit unstable venous hemostatic thrombi. The factor VIII-binding ability of von Willebrand factor regulates arteriole thrombosis dynamics.
SUMMARY: Background von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) circulate as a non-covalent complex, with VWF serving as the carrier for FVIII. VWF indirectly influences secondary hemostasis by stabilizing FVIII and transporting it to the site of primary hemostasis. Type 2N von Willebrand disease involves impaired binding of VWF to FVIII, resulting in decreased plasma levels of FVIII. Objectives In these studies, we characterize the impact of three type 2N VWD variants (R763A, R854Q, R816W) on VWF secretion, FVIII stabilization and thrombus formation in a murine model. Methods Type 2N VWD mice were generated by hydrodynamic injections of mutant murine VWF cDNAs and the influence of these variants on VWF secretion and FVIII binding was evaluated. In vivo hemostasis and the dynamics of thrombus formation and embolization were assessed using a murine tail vein transection hemostasis model and an intravital thrombosis model in the cremaster arterioles. Results Type 2N VWD variants were associated with decreased VWF secretion using cell and animal-based models. FVIII-binding to type 2N variants was impaired in vitro and was variably stabilized in vivo by expressed or infused 2N variant VWF protein. Both transgenic type 2N VWD and FVIII knockout (KO) mice demonstrated impaired thrombus formation associated with decreased thrombus stability. Conclusions The type 2N VWD phenotype can be recapitulated in a murine model and is associated with both quantitative and qualitative VWF deficiencies and impaired thrombus formation. Patients with type 2N VWD may have normal primary hemostasis formation but decreased thrombus stability related to ineffective secondary hemostasis.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

In previous reports, less than 90% heteroplasmy was shown to result in adult-onset disease. Here, by whole mitochondrial sequencing, we identified m.14597A>G mutation of a patient with LS. PCR-RFLP analysis on fibroblasts from the patient revealed a high mutation load (> 90% heteroplasmy). We performed functional assays using cybrid cell models generated by fusing mtDNA-less rho0 HeLa cells with enucleated cells from patient fibroblasts carrying the m.14597A>G variant. Cybrid cell lines bearing the m.14597A>G variant exhibited severe effects on mitochondrial complex I activity. Additionally, impairment of cell proliferation, decreased ATP production and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in the cybrid cell lines bearing the m.14597A>G variant when the cells were metabolically stressed in medium containing galactose, indicating mitochondrial respiratory chain defects. These results suggest that a high mutation load of m.14597A>G leads to LS via a mitochondrial complex I defect, rather than LHON or dementia/dysarthria.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
27212476,"von Willebrand disease (VWD)-type 2B is characterized by gain-of-function mutations in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1-domain, leading to increased affinity for its platelet-receptor, glycoprotein Ibα. We engineered the first knock-in (KI) murine model for VWD-type 2B by introducing the p.V1316M mutation in murine VWF. Homozygous KI-mice replicated human VWD-type 2B with macrothrombocytopenia (platelet counts reduced by 55%, platelet volume increased by 44%), circulating platelet-aggregates and a severe bleeding tendency. Also, vessel occlusion was deficient in the FeCl3-induced thrombosis model. Platelet aggregation induced by thrombin or collagen was defective for KI-mice at all doses. KI-mice manifested a loss of high molecular weight multimers and increased multimer degradation. In a model of VWF-string formation, the number of platelets/string and string-lifetime were surprisingly enhanced in KI-mice, suggesting that proteolysis of VWF/p.V1316M is differentially regulated in the circulation versus the endothelial surface. Furthermore, we observed increased leukocyte recruitment during an inflammatory response induced by the reverse passive Arthus reaction. This points to an active role of VWF/p.V1316M in the exfiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, our genetically-engineered VWD-type 2B mice represent an original model to study the consequences of spontaneous VWF-platelet interactions and the physiopathology of this human disease.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
29186156,"Rheological forces in the blood trigger the unfolding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its A2 domain, exposing the scissile bond for proteolysis by ADAMTS13. Under quiescent conditions, the scissile bond is hidden by the folded structure due to the stabilisation provided by the structural specialisations of the VWF A2 domain, a vicinal disulphide bond, a calcium binding site and a N1574-glycan.The reduced circulating high MW multimers of VWF in patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease (VWD) may be associated with mutations within the VWF A2 domain and this is attributed to enhanced ADAMTS13 proteolysis. We investigated 11 VWF A2 domain variants identified in patients with type 2A VWD. In recombinant full-length VWF, enhanced ADAMTS13 proteolysis was detected for all of the expressed variants in the presence of urea-induced denaturation. A subset of the FLVWF variants displayed enhanced proteolysis in the absence of urea. The mechanism of enhancement was investigated using a novel VWF A2 domain FRET construct. In the absence of induced unfolding, 7/8 of the expressed mutants exhibited a disrupted domain fold, causing spatial separation of the N- and C- termini. Three of the type 2A mutants were not secreted when studied within the VWF A2 domain FRET construct. Urea denaturation revealed for all 8 secreted mutants reduced unfolding cooperativity and stability of the VWF A2 domain. As folding stability was progressively disrupted, proteolysis by ADAMTS13 increased. Due to the range of folding stabilities and wide distribution of VWF A2 domain mutations studied, we conclude that these mutations disrupt regulated folding of the VWF A2 domain. They enhance unfolding by inducing separation of N- and C-termini, thereby promoting a more open conformation that reveals its binding sites for ADAMTS13 and the scissile bond.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
22372972,"BACKGROUND: von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is tightly regulated by the metalloproteinase ADAMTS13, which cleaves VWF to reduce VWF multimer size and binding affinity for collagen and platelets.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines two VWF mutations, R1597W (enhanced cleavage) and Y1605A-M1606A (decreased cleavage), to determine their impact on VWF, in addition to ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage.
METHODS: In vitro mouse ADAMTS13 digestions were performed on recombinant proteins. VWF knockout mice received hydrodynamic injections of mouse Vwf cDNA, following which VWF antigen, multimer profile and VWF propeptide levels were determined. A ferric chloride injury model of thrombosis was also evaluated.
RESULTS: In vitro ADAMTS13 digestion of full-length mouse VWF required > 97-fold higher ADAMTS13 levels for Y1605A/M1606A, and 68% lower ADAMTS13 levels for R1597W compared with wild type. In vivo, R1597W had reduced VWF:Ag and both mutations exhibited increased VWF propeptide/VWF:Ag ratios. R1597W multimers show a lower molecular weight profile compared with wild type and Y1605A/M1606A mice. When co-injected with Adamts13 cDNA, Y1605A/M1606A multimers were larger compared with wild type, and R1597W showed only a single multimer band and decreased clearance via VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio. R1597W was associated with reduced thrombus formation but normal platelet accumulation in a ferric chloride injury model while Y1605A/M1606A had a loss of occlusive thrombi but increased platelet accumulation compared with wild type.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that mutations that alter ADAMTS13 cleavage also can affect VWF clearance, VWF antigen level, multimer structure and thrombotic potential in the VWF knockout hydrodynamic injection model.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
22507569,"BACKGROUND: von Willebrand factor (VWF) binds to subendothelial collagen at sites of vascular injury. Laboratory testing for von Willebrand disease (VWD), however, does not always include collagen binding assays (VWF:CB) and standard VWF:CB assays use type I and/or type III collagen rather than type VI collagen.
OBJECTIVES: We report here on several mutations that exclusively alter binding to type VI collagen.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Healthy controls and index cases from the Zimmerman Program for the Molecular and Clinical Biology of VWD were analyzed for VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin cofactor activity and VWF:CB with types I, III and VI collagen. VWF gene sequencing was performed for all subjects.
RESULTS: Two healthy controls and one type 1 VWD subject were heterozygous for an A1 domain sequence variation, R1399H, and displayed a selective decreased binding to type VI collagen but not types I and III. Expression of recombinant 1399H VWF resulted in absent binding to type VI collagen. Two other VWF A1 domain mutations, S1387I and Q1402P, displayed diminished binding to type VI collagen. An 11 amino acid deletion in the A1 domain also abrogated binding to type VI collagen.
CONCLUSIONS: VWF:CB may be useful in diagnosis of VWD, as a decreased VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratio may reflect specific loss of collagen binding ability. Mutations that exclusively affect type VI collagen binding may be associated with bleeding, yet missed by current VWF testing.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
16221672,"ADAMTS13 controls the multimeric size of circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) by cleaving the Tyr1605-Met1606 bond in theA2 domain. To examine substrate recognition, we expressed in bacteria and purified three A2 (VWF76-(1593-1668), VWF115-(1554-1668), VWFA2-(1473-1668)) and one A2-A3 (VWF115-A3-(1554-1874)) domain fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, the initial rates of VWF115 cleavage by ADAMTS13 at different substrate concentrations were determined, and from this the kinetic constants were derived (Km 1.61 microM; kcat 0.14 s(-1)), from which the specificity constant kcat/Km was calculated, 8.70 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). Similar values of the specificity constant were obtained for VWF76 and VWF115-A3. To identify residues important for recognition and proteolysis of VWF115, we introduced certain type 2A von Willebrand disease mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most were cleaved normally, one (D1614G) was cleaved approximately 8-fold slower. Mutagenesis of additional charged residues predicted to be in close proximity to Asp1614 on the surface of the A2 domain (R1583A, D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, K1617A, E1638A, E1640A) revealed up to 13-fold reduction in kcat/Km for D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, and K1617A mutants. When introduced into the intact VWFA2 domain, proteolysis of the D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A mutants was also slowed, particularly in the presence of urea. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated appreciable reduction in binding affinity between ADAMTS13 and VWF115 mutants (KD up to approximately 1.3 microM), compared with VWF115 (KD 20 nM). These results demonstrate an important role for Asp1614 and surrounding charged residues in the binding and cleavage of the VWFA2 domain by ADAMTS13.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
23110044,"The hemostatic function of von Willebrand factor is downregulated by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which cleaves at a unique site normally buried in the A2 domain. Exposure of the proteolytic site is induced in the wild-type by shear stress as von Willebrand factor circulates in blood. Mutations in the A2 domain, which increase its susceptibility to cleavage, cause type 2A von Willebrand disease. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the A2 domain unfolds under tensile force progressively through a series of steps. The simulation results also indicated that three type 2A mutations in the C-terminal half of the A2 domain, L1657I, I1628T and E1638K, destabilize the native state fold of the protein. Furthermore, all three type 2A mutations lowered in silico the tensile force necessary to undock the C-terminal helix α6 from the rest of the A2 domain, the first event in the unfolding pathway. The mutations F1520A, I1651A and A1661G were also predicted by simulations to destabilize the A2 domain and facilitate exposure of the cleavage site. Recombinant A2 domain proteins were expressed and cleavage assays were performed with the wild-type and single-point mutants. All three type 2A and two of the three predicted mutations exhibited increased rate of cleavage by ADAMTS13. These results confirm that destabilization of the helix α6 in the A2 domain facilitates exposure of the cleavage site and increases the rate of cleavage by ADAMTS13.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
31628947,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF), an exceptionally large multimeric plasma glycoprotein, functions to initiate coagulation by agglutinating platelets in the blood stream to sites of vascular injury. This primary hemostatic function is perturbed in type 2 dysfunctional subtypes of von Willebrand disease (VWD) by mutations that alter the structure and function of the platelet GPIbα adhesive VWF A1 domains. The resulting amino acid substitutions cause local disorder and misfold the native structure of the isolated platelet GPIbα-adhesive A1 domain of VWF in both gain-of-function (type 2B) and loss-of-function (type 2M) phenotypes. These structural effects have not been explicitly observed in A1 domains of VWF multimers native to blood plasma. New mass spectrometry strategies are applied to resolve the structural effects of 2B and 2M mutations in VWF to verify the presence of A1 domain structural disorder in multimeric VWF harboring type 2 VWD mutations. Limited trypsinolysis mass spectrometry (LTMS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) are applied to wild-type and VWD variants of the single A1, A2, and A3 domains, an A1A2A3 tridomain fragment of VWF, plasmin-cleaved dimers of VWF, multimeric recombinant VWF, and normal VWF plasma concentrates. Comparatively, these methods show that mutations known to misfold the isolated A1 domain increase the rate of trypsinolysis and the extent of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in local secondary structures of A1 within multimeric VWF. VWD mutation effects are localized to the A1 domain without appreciably affecting the structure and dynamics of other VWF domains. The intrinsic dynamics of A1 observed in recombinant fragments of VWF are conserved in plasma-derived VWF. These studies reveal that structural disorder does occur in VWD variants of the A1 domain within multimeric VWF and provides strong support for VWF misfolding as a result of some, but not all, type 2 VWD variants.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

However, the analysis of these aberrant VWF-collagen interactions has been limited. Here, we have developed mouse models of collagen-binding mutants and analyzed the function of the A3 domain using comprehensive in vitro and in vivo approaches. Five loss-of-function (p.S1731T, p.W1745C, p.S1783A, p.H1786D, A3 deletion) and 1 gain-of-function (p.L1757A) variants were generated in the mouse VWF complementary DNA. The results of these various assays were consistent, although the magnitude of the effects were different: the gain-of-function (p.L1757A) variant showed consistent enhanced collagen binding whereas the loss-of-function mutants showed variable degrees of functional deficit. We further analyzed the impact of direct platelet-collagen binding by blocking glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin α2β1 in our ferric chloride murine thrombosis model. The inhibition of GPVI demonstrated a comparable functional defect in thrombosis formation to the VWF(-/-) mice whereas α2β1 inhibition demonstrated a milder bleeding phenotype. Furthermore, a delayed and markedly reduced thrombogenic response was still evident in VWF(-/-), GPVI, and α2β1 blocked animals, suggesting that alternative primary hemostatic mechanisms can partially rescue the bleeding phenotype associated with these defects.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
1409710,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib. For human vWF, this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin. A missense mutation, Gly-561-->Ser, was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B, a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced, but normal botrocetin-induced, binding to glycoprotein Ib. The corresponding mutant recombinant protein, rvWF(G561S), formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patient's plasma vWF, confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B. These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms. The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF(G561S) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
24982166,"Fibrillin microfibrils are 10-12 nm diameter, extracellular matrix assemblies that provide dynamic tissues of metazoan species with many of their biomechanical properties as well as sequestering growth factors and cytokines. Assembly of fibrillin monomers into microfibrils is thought to occur at the cell surface, with initial steps including proprotein processing, multimerization driven by the C terminus, and the head-to-tail alignment of adjacent molecules. At present the mechanisms that regulate microfibril assembly are still to be elucidated. We have used structure-informed protein engineering to create a recombinant, GFP-tagged version of fibrillin-1 (GFP-Fbn) to study this process. Using HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-Fbn constructs, we show that (i) the C-terminal propeptide is an essential requirement for the secretion of full-length fibrillin-1 from cells; (ii) failure to cleave off the C-terminal propeptide blocks the assembly of fibrillin-1 into microfibrils produced by dermal fibroblasts; and (iii) the requirement of the propeptide for secretion is linked to the presence of domains cbEGF41-43, because either deletion or exchange of domains in this region leads to cellular retention.

To date, more than 1100 PAH variants have been identified of which a substantial portion have unknown clinical significance. In this work, we study the functionality of seven yet uncharacterized PAH missense variants p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, p.Asp229Gly, p.Gly239Ala, p.Phe263Ser, p.Ala342Pro, and p.Ile406Met first identified in the Czech PKU/HPA patients. From all tested variants, three of them, namely p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, and p.Ile406Met, exerted residual enzymatic activity in vitro similar to wild type (WT) PAH, however, when expressed in HepG2 cells, their protein level reached a maximum of 72.1% ± 4.9%, 11.2% ± 4.2%, and 36.6% ± 7.3% compared to WT PAH, respectively. Remaining variants were null with no enzyme activity and decreased protein levels in HepG2 cells. The chaperone-like effect of applied BH4 precursor increased protein level significantly for p.Asn167Tyr, p.Asp229Gly, p.Ala342Pro, and p.Ile406Met. Taken together, our results of functional characterization in combination with in silico prediction suggest that while p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, and p.Ile406Met PAH variants have a mild impact on the protein, p.Asp229Gly, p.Gly239Ala, p.Phe263Ser, and p.Ala342Pro severely affect protein structure and function.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Similar to the VLDLR mutants, LDLR mutants D482H and C667F were found to be localized to the ER, while D445E, which is a conserved amino acid change, did not affect the trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane, as confirmed by the N-glycosylation profile. Although the ER-retained mutant proteins were soluble, induction of ER stress was observed as indicated by spliced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA levels.

RRAS2 is a member of the RAS subfamily and is ubiquitously expressed. Three variants, c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup), c.216A>T (p.Gln72His), and c.215A>T (p.Gln72Leu), have been found in cancers; our functional analyses showed that these three changes induced elevated association of RAF1 and that they activated ERK1/2 and ELK1. Notably, prominent activation of ERK1/2 and ELK1 by p.Gln72Leu associates with the severe phenotype of the individual harboring this change. To examine variant pathogenicity in vivo, we generated zebrafish models. Larvae overexpressing c.70_78dup (p.Gly24_Gly26dup) or c.216A>T (p.Gln72His) variants, but not wild-type RRAS2 RNAs, showed craniofacial defects and macrocephaly.

31130282,"Aberrant signaling through pathways controlling cell response to extracellular stimuli constitutes a central theme in disorders affecting development. Signaling through RAS and the MAPK cascade controls a variety of cell decisions in response to cytokines, hormones, and growth factors, and its upregulation causes Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder whose major features include a distinctive facies, a wide spectrum of cardiac defects, short stature, variable cognitive impairment, and predisposition to malignancies. NS is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in more than ten genes have been reported to underlie this disorder. Despite the large number of genes implicated, about 10%-20% of affected individuals with a clinical diagnosis of NS do not have mutations in known RASopathy-associated genes, indicating that additional unidentified genes contribute to the disease, when mutated. By using a mixed strategy of functional candidacy and exome sequencing, we identify RRAS2 as a gene implicated in NS in six unrelated subjects/families. We show that the NS-causing RRAS2 variants affect highly conserved residues localized around the nucleotide binding pocket of the GTPase and are predicted to variably affect diverse aspects of RRAS2 biochemical behavior, including nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and interaction with effectors.

Surgical specimens from 22 patients with meningiomas were used for cellular, immunological and molecular techniques (immunofluorescence, western blotting, RT-PCR and biochemical assay of enzyme activity) to investigate the expression and activity of IDO. In addition, PET imaging was obtained preoperatively in 10 patients using the tracer α-[ ( 11) C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) which interrogates the uptake and metabolism of tryptophan. Strong AMT accumulation was noted in all meningiomas by PET imaging indicating in vivo tryptophan uptake. Freshly-resected meningiomas expressed both LAT1, the tryptophan transporter system and IDO, demonstrating an active kynurenine pathway. Dissociated meningioma cells lost IDO expression.

Expression of dynamin-2 constructs carrying CNM-linked mutations disrupted the formation of new actin filaments as well as the stimulus-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Similarly, mature muscle fibers isolated from heterozygous knock-in mice that harbor the dynamin-2 mutation p.R465W, an animal model of CNM, exhibited altered actin organization, reduced actin polymerization and impaired insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the sarcolemma. Moreover, GLUT4 displayed aberrant perinuclear accumulation in biopsies from CNM patients carrying dynamin-2 mutations, further suggesting trafficking defects. These results suggest that dynamin-2 is a key regulator of actin dynamics and GLUT4 trafficking in muscle cells. Our findings also support a model in which impairment of actin-dependent trafficking contributes to the pathological mechanism in dynamin-2-associated CNM.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
20700106,"The large GTPase dynamin has an important membrane scission function in receptor-mediated endocytosis and other cellular processes. Self-assembly on phosphoinositide-containing membranes stimulates dynamin GTPase activity, which is crucial for its function. Although the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain is known to mediate phosphoinositide binding by dynamin, it remains unclear how this promotes activation. Here, we describe studies of dynamin PH domain mutations found in centronuclear myopathy (CNM) that increase dynamin's GTPase activity without altering phosphoinositide binding. CNM mutations in the PH domain C-terminal α-helix appear to cause conformational changes in dynamin that alter control of the GTP hydrolysis cycle. These mutations either 'sensitize' dynamin to lipid stimulation or elevate basal GTPase rates by promoting self-assembly and thus rendering dynamin no longer lipid responsive. We also describe a low-resolution structure of dimeric dynamin from small-angle X-ray scattering that reveals conformational changes induced by CNM mutations, and defines requirements for domain rearrangement upon dynamin self-assembly at membrane surfaces. Our data suggest that changes in the PH domain may couple lipid binding to dynamin GTPase activation at sites of vesicle invagination.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
34744632,"Mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 2 (DNM2), a GTPase that catalyzes membrane constriction and fission, are associated with two autosomal-dominant motor disorders, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and centronuclear myopathy (CNM), which affect nerve and muscle, respectively. Many of these mutations affect the pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2, yet there is almost no overlap between the sets of mutations that cause CMT or CNM. A subset of CMT-linked mutations inhibit the interaction of DNM2 with phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, which is essential for DNM2 function in endocytosis. In contrast, CNM-linked mutations inhibit intramolecular interactions that normally suppress dynamin self-assembly and GTPase activation. Hence, CNM-linked DNM2 mutants form abnormally stable polymers and express enhanced assembly-dependent GTPase activation. These distinct effects of CMT and CNM mutations are consistent with current findings that DNM2-dependent CMT and CNM are loss-of-function and gain-of-function diseases, respectively. In this study, we present evidence that at least one CMT-causing DNM2 mutant (ΔDEE; lacking residues 555DEE557) forms polymers that, like the CNM mutants, are resistant to disassembly and display enhanced GTPase activation. We further show that the ΔDEE mutant undergoes 2-3-fold higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation than wild-type DNM2. These results suggest that molecular mechanisms underlying the absence of pathogenic overlap between DNM2-dependent CMT and CNM should be re-examined.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
20529869,"Mutations in the dynamin 2 gene have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant forms of centronuclear myopathy (CNM). Dynamin 2 is a ubiquitously expressed approximately 100-kDa GTPase that assembles around the necks of vesiculating membranes and promotes their constriction and scission. It has also been implicated in regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. At present, the cellular functions of dynamin 2 that are affected by CNM-linked mutations are not well defined, and the effects of these mutations on the physical and enzymatic properties of dynamin have been not examined. Here, we report the expression, purification, and characterization of four CNM-associated dynamin mutants. All four mutants display higher than wild-type GTPase activities, and more importantly, the mutants form high order oligomers that are significantly more resistant than wild-type dynamin 2 to disassembly by guanine nucleotides or high ionic strength. These observations suggest that the corresponding wild-type residues serve to prevent excessive or prolonged dynamin assembly on cellular membranes or inappropriate self-assembly in the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this report contains the first identification of point mutations that enhance the stability of dynamin polymers without impairing their ability to bind and/or hydrolyze GTP. We envision that the formation of abnormally large and stable complexes of these dynamin mutants in vivo contributes to their role in CNM pathogenesis.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
30291191,"Centronuclear myopathies (CNM) are a group of severe muscle diseases for which no effective therapy is currently available. We have previously shown that reduction of the large GTPase DNM2 in a mouse model of the X-linked form, due to loss of myotubularin phosphatase MTM1, prevents the development of the skeletal muscle pathophysiology. As DNM2 is mutated in autosomal dominant forms, here we tested whether DNM2 reduction can rescue DNM2-related CNM in a knock-in mouse harboring the p.R465W mutation (Dnm2RW/+) and displaying a mild CNM phenotype similar to patients with the same mutation. A single intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus-shRNA targeting Dnm2 resulted in reduction in protein levels 5 wk post injection, with a corresponding improvement in muscle mass and fiber size distribution, as well as an improvement in histopathological CNM features. To establish a systemic treatment, weekly i.p. injections of antisense oligonucleotides targeting Dnm2 were administered to Dnm2RW/+mice for 5 wk. While muscle mass, histopathology, and muscle ultrastructure were perturbed in Dnm2RW/+mice compared with wild-type mice, these features were indistinguishable from wild-type mice after reducing DNM2. Therefore, DNM2 knockdown via two different strategies can efficiently correct the myopathy due to DNM2 mutations, and it provides a common therapeutic strategy for several forms of centronuclear myopathy. Furthermore, we provide an example of treating a dominant disease by targeting both alleles, suggesting that this strategy may be applied to other dominant diseases.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
10900271,"The lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] plays a crucial role in intracellular membrane trafficking. We report here that myotubularin, a protein tyrosine phosphatase required for muscle cell differentiation, is a potent PI(3)P phosphatase. Recombinant human myotubularin specifically dephosphorylates PI(3)P in vitro. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive substrate-trapping myotubularin mutant (C375S) in human 293 cells increases PI(3)P levels relative to that of cells overexpressing the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that PI(3)P is a substrate for myotubularin in vivo. In addition, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in which the myotubularin-like gene (YJR110w) is disrupted also exhibits increased PI(3)P levels. Both the recombinant yeast enzyme and a human myotubularin-related protein (KIAA0371) are able to dephosphorylate PI(3)P in vitro, suggesting that this activity is intrinsic to all myotubularin family members. Mutations in the MTM1 gene that cause human myotubular myopathy dramatically reduce the ability of the phosphatase to dephosphorylate PI(3)P. Our findings provide evidence that myotubularin exerts its effects during myogenesis by regulating cellular levels of the inositol lipid PI(3)P.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
22068590,"X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe neuromuscular disease of infancy caused by mutations of MTM1, which encodes the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, myotubularin. The Mtm1 knockout (KO) mouse has a severe phenotype and its short lifespan (8 weeks) makes it a challenge to use as a model in the testing of certain preclinical therapeutics. Many MTM patients succumb early in life, but some have a more favorable prognosis. We used human genotype-phenotype correlation data to develop a myotubularin-deficient mouse model with a less severe phenotype than is seen in Mtm1 KO mice. We modeled the human c.205C>T point mutation in Mtm1 exon 4, which is predicted to introduce the p.R69C missense change in myotubularin. Hemizygous male Mtm1 p.R69C mice develop early muscle atrophy prior to the onset of weakness at 2 months. The median survival period is 66 weeks. Histopathology shows small myofibers with centrally placed nuclei. Myotubularin protein is undetectably low because the introduced c.205C>T base change induced exon 4 skipping in most mRNAs, leading to premature termination of myotubularin translation. Some full-length Mtm1 mRNA bearing the mutation is present, which provides enough myotubularin activity to account for the relatively mild phenotype, as Mtm1 KO and Mtm1 p.R69C mice have similar muscle phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels. These data explain the basis for phenotypic variability among human patients with MTM1 p.R69C mutations and establish the Mtm1 p.R69C mouse as a valuable model for the disease, as its less severe phenotype will expand the scope of testable preclinical therapies.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Compound-heterozygous mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) cause typical nemaline myopathy (NM), a muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness with limited treatment options. We created a mouse model with a missense mutation p.Ser6366Ile and a deletion of NEB exon 55, the Compound-Het model that resembles typical NM. We show that Compound-Het mice are growth-retarded and have muscle weakness. Muscles have a reduced myofibrillar fractional-area and sarcomeres are disorganized, contain rod bodies, and have longer thin filaments. In contrast to nebulin-based severe NM where haplo-insufficiency is the disease driver, Compound-Het mice express normal amounts of nebulin. X-ray diffraction revealed that the actin filament is twisted with a larger radius, that tropomyosin and troponin behavior is altered, and that the myofilament spacing is increased.

The diagnosis of congenital myopathies is constrained by strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, the majority of patients present with unspecific histological features, precluding purposive molecular diagnosis and demonstrating the need for an alternative and more efficient diagnostic approach. We used exome sequencing complemented by histological and ultrastructural analysis of muscle biopsies to identify the causative mutations in eight patients with clinically different skeletal muscle pathologies, ranging from a fatal neonatal myopathy to a mild and slowly progressive myopathy with adult onset. We identified RYR1 (ryanodine receptor) mutations in six patients and NEB (nebulin) mutations in two patients. We found novel missense and nonsense mutations, unraveled small insertions/deletions and confirmed their impact on splicing and mRNA/protein stability. Histological and ultrastructural findings of the muscle biopsies of the patients validated the exome sequencing results. We provide the evidence that an integrated strategy combining exome sequencing with clinical and histopathological investigations overcomes the limitations of the individual approaches to allow a fast and efficient diagnosis, accelerating the patient's access to a better healthcare and disease management.

29734338,"RIT1 belongs to the RAS family of small GTPases. Germline and somatic RIT1 mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome (NS) and cancer, respectively. By using heterologous expression systems and purified recombinant proteins, we identified the p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as novel direct effector of RIT1. We found RIT1 also to directly interact with the RHO GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, both of which are crucial regulators of actin dynamics upstream of PAK1. These interactions are independent of the guanine nucleotide bound to RIT1. Disease-causing RIT1 mutations enhance protein-protein interaction between RIT1 and PAK1, CDC42 or RAC1 and uncouple complex formation from serum and growth factors. We show that the RIT1-PAK1 complex regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements as expression of wild-type RIT1 and its mutant forms resulted in dissolution of stress fibers and reduction of mature paxillin-containing focal adhesions in COS7 cells. This effect was prevented by co-expression of RIT1 with dominant-negative CDC42 or RAC1 and kinase-dead PAK1. By using a transwell migration assay, we show that RIT1 wildtype and the disease-associated variants enhance cell motility. Our work demonstrates a new function for RIT1 in controlling actin dynamics via acting in a signaling module containing PAK1 and RAC1/CDC42, and highlights defects in cell adhesion and migration as possible disease mechanism underlying NS.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

The cost for the structural flexibility required for this function is the vulnerability to mutations that impact its folding pathway.

Only three mutations in SERPINC1 affecting two residues have been found to favour transformation to the latent conformation of antithrombin, another hyperstable non-anticoagulant form with strong antiangiogenic activity that constitutes 3 % of plasma antithrombin in healthy subjects. The analysis of latent antithrombin in 141 unrelated patients with antithrombin deficiency carrying 89 different SERPINC1 mutations identified four cases with higher levels than that of controls: p.Pro439Thr, p.Pro461Ser, p.Met283Val, and p.His401Tyr, the last also with circulating polymers. Heating of plasma at 42ºC exacerbated the transformation to the latent conformation in p.Pro439Thr and p.Pro461Ser. The conformational effect of p.Met283Val, the mutation associated with the highest levels of latent antithrombin detected in four members of a family, was verified in a recombinant model. Antithrombin deficiency in these cases should be classified as pleiotropic based on the impaired reactivity and low heparin affinity of the variant. Despite high levels of latent antithrombin (up to 80 µg/ml in p.Met283Val carriers), no vascular defects were described in carriers of these mutations. In conclusion, our study identifies new residues involved in the structural stability of antithrombin (and potentially of all serpins). High levels of endogenous latent antithrombin seem to play a minor antiangiogenic effect. Finally, pleiotropic deficiencies may be caused by mutations inducing transformation to the latent conformation.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

It has been proposed that the high frequency is due to a founder effect. In this paper, we characterized 24 mutant LDL receptor alleles from 12 Afrikaner individuals homozygous for FH. We identified two mutations that together makeup greater than 95% of the mutant LDL receptor genes represented in our sample. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that result in single-amino acid changes. Each mutation can be detected readily with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The finding of two common LDL receptor mutations in the Afrikaner FH homozygotes predicts that these mutations will predominate in the Afrikaner population and that the high frequency of FH is due to a founder effect. The increased incidence of ischemic heart disease in the Afrikaner population may in part be due to the high frequency of these two mutations in the LDL receptor gene.",PS3_moderate,1,0,,0,

We found novel germline mutations in established CRC genes MLH1, APC, and POLE, and likely pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes BAP1, CDH1, CHEK2, ENG, and MSH3. For the candidate CRC genes, we identified likely pathogenic variants in the helicase domain of POLQ and in the LRIG1, SH2B3, and NOS1 genes and present their clinicopathological characteristics.

They are caused by germline variants in genes encoding key components or modulators of the highly conserved RAS-MAPK signalling pathway that lead to dysregulation of cell signal transmission. Germline changes in the genes encoding members of the RAS subfamily of GTPases are rare and associated with variable phenotypes of the RASopathy spectrum, ranging from Costello syndrome (HRAS variants) to Noonan and Cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes (KRAS variants). A small number of RASopathy cases with disease-causing germline NRAS alterations have been reported. Affected individuals exhibited features fitting Noonan syndrome, and the observed germline variants differed from the typical oncogenic NRAS changes occurring as somatic events in tumours. Here we describe 19 new cases with RASopathy due to disease-causing variants in NRAS. Importantly, four of them harbored missense changes affecting Gly12, which was previously described to occur exclusively in cancer. The phenotype in our cohort was variable but well within the RASopathy spectrum. Further, one of the patients (c.35G>A; p.(Gly12Asp)) had a myeloproliferative disorder, and one subject (c.34G>C; p.(Gly12Arg)) exhibited an uncharacterized brain tumour.

We determined the functional consequences of three mutations linked to FHM3 (L263V, Q1489K, and L1649Q) in an effort to identify molecular defects that underlie this inherited migraine disorder. Only L263V and Q1489K generated quantifiable sodium currents when coexpressed in tsA201 cells with the human beta(1) and beta(2) accessory subunits. The third mutant, L1649Q, failed to generate measurable whole-cell current because of markedly reduced cell surface expression. Compared to WT-Na(V)1.1, Q1489K exhibited increased persistent current but also enhanced entry into slow inactivation as well as delayed recovery from fast and slow inactivation, thus resulting in a predominantly loss-of-function phenotype further demonstrated by a greater loss of channel availability during repetitive stimulation. In contrast, L263V exhibited gain-of-function features, including delayed entry into, as well as accelerated recovery from, fast inactivation; depolarizing shifts in the steady-state voltage dependence of fast and slow inactivation; increased persistent current; and delayed entry into slow inactivation. Notably, the two mutations (Q1489K and L1649Q) that exhibited partial or complete loss of function are linked to typical FHM, whereas the gain-of-function mutation L263V occurred in a family having both FHM and a high incidence of generalized epilepsy.

We studied the FHM mutation Q1489K by transfecting tsA-201 cells and cultured neurons with human Na(v)1.1. We show that the mutation has effects on the gating properties of the channel that can be consistent with both hyperexcitability and hypoexcitability. Simulation of neuronal firing and long depolarizing pulses mimicking promigraine conditions revealed that the effect of the mutation is a gain of function consistent with increased neuronal firing. However, during high-frequency discharges and long depolarizations, the effect became a loss of function. Recordings of firing of transfected neurons showed higher firing frequency at the beginning of long discharges. This self-limited capacity to induce neuronal hyperexcitability may be a specific characteristic of migraine mutations, able to both trigger the cascade of events that leads to migraine and counteract the development of extreme hyperexcitability typical of epileptic seizures.

Sequencing analysis detected a 6-bp deletion in exon 28 of his VWF gene, which created a mutant lacking D1529V1530 residues in VWF A2 domain. This mutation also existed in his family members with abnormal bleedings but not in >60 normal controls.

The mutant VWF in the medium had less HMW multimers. In contrast, the intracellular levels of the mutant VWF in the transfected cells were significantly higher than that of WT (174±29%, p<0.05), indicating intracellular retention of the mutant VWF. In co-transfection experiments, the mutant reduced WT VWF secretion from the cells. By immunofluorescence staining, the retention of the mutant VWF was identified within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Together, we identified a unique VWF mutation responsible for the bleeding phenotype in a patient family with type 2A VWD. The mutation impaired VWF trafficking through the ER, thereby preventing VWF secretion from the cells.

We show that in human cells, respirasome biogenesis involves a complex I assembly intermediate acting as a scaffold for the combined incorporation of complexes III and IV subunits, rather than originating from the association of preassembled individual holoenzymes. The process ends with the incorporation of complex I NADH dehydrogenase catalytic module, which leads to the respirasome activation.

33380464,"Mitochondrial diseases linked to mutations in mitochondrial (mt) tRNA sequences are common. However, the contributions of these tRNA mutations to the development of diseases is mostly unknown. Mutations may affect interactions with (mt)tRNA maturation enzymes or protein synthesis machinery leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In human mitochondria, in most cases the first step of tRNA processing is the removal of the 5' leader of precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNA) catalyzed by the three-component enzyme, mtRNase P. Additionally, one component of mtRNase P, mitochondrial RNase P protein 1 (MRPP1), catalyzes methylation of the R9 base in pre-tRNAs. Despite the central role of 5' end processing in mitochondrial tRNA maturation, the link between mtRNase P and diseases is mostly unexplored. Here, we investigate how 11 different human disease-linked mutations in (mt)pre-tRNAIle, (mt)pre-tRNALeu(UUR), and (mt)pre-tRNAMet affect the activities of mtRNase P. We find that several mutations weaken the pre-tRNA binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> s are approximately two- to sixfold higher than that of wild-type), while the majority of mutations decrease 5' end processing and methylation activity catalyzed by mtRNase P (up to ∼55% and 90% reduction, respectively). Furthermore, all of the investigated mutations in (mt)pre-tRNALeu(UUR) alter the tRNA fold which contributes to the partial loss of function of mtRNase P.

We assessed the diagnosis rate and genetic spectrum of MgD using next-generation sequencing in patients with late adolescence/adult-onset diabetes referred for a clinical suspicion of MgD.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in 1564 probands recruited in 116 Endocrinology departments. Inclusion criteria were the absence of diabetes autoantibodies, and at least two of the three following criteria: an age ≤ 40 years and a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2 at diagnosis in the proband or in at least two relatives with diabetes, and a family history of diabetes in ≥ 2 generations. Seven genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, ABCC8, KCNJ11, and INS) were analyzed. Variant pathogenicity was assessed using current guidelines.
RESULTS: Pathogenic variants were identified in 254 patients (16.2%) and in 23.2% of EuroCaucasian patients. Using more stringent selection criteria (family history of diabetes in ≥ 3 generations, age at diabetes ≤ 40 years and BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 in the proband, EuroCaucasian origin) increased the diagnosis rate to 43%, but with 70% of the identified cases being missed. GCK (44%), HNF1A (33%), and HNF4A (10%) accounted for the majority of the cases. HNF1B (6%), ABCC8/KCNJ11 (4.4%), and INS (2.8%) variants accounted for 13% of the cases. As compared to non-monogenic cases, a younger age, a lower BMI and the absence of diabetes symptoms at diagnosis, a EuroCaucasian origin, and a family history of diabetes in ≥ 3 generations were associated with MgD, but with wide phenotype overlaps between the two groups. In the total population, two clusters were identified, that mainly differed by the severity of diabetes at onset. MgDs were more prevalent in the milder phenotypic cluster. The phenotypes of the 59 patients (3.8%) with variants of uncertain significance were different from that of patients with pathogenic variants, but not from that of non-monogenic patients.
CONCLUSION: Variants of HNF1B and the K-ATP channel genes were more frequently involved in MgD than previously reported. Phenotype overlapping makes the diagnosis of MgD difficult in adolescents/adults and underlies the benefit of NGS in clinically selected patients.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,

The relative specific activity of wild-type and variant α-iduronidase was determined using a combination of Western blot analysis and α-iduronidase activity assays. The specific activity of each variant enzyme was consistent across different single cell clones despite variable IDUA expression and could be accurately determined down to 0.05-0.01% of WT α-iduronidase activity. With this strategy we compared the specific activities of known pseudodeficiency variants (p.His82Gln, p.Ala79Thr, p.Val322Glu, p.Asp223Asn) or pathogenic variants (p.Ser633Leu, p.His240Arg) with variants of uncertain significance (p.Ser586Phe, p.Ile272Leu). The p.Ser633Leu and p.His240Arg variants both show very low activities consistent with their association with Scheie syndrome. In our experiments, however, p.His240Arg exhibited a specific activity five times higher than p.Ser633Leu in contrast to other reports showing equivalent activity. Cell clones expressing the p.Ser586Phe and p.Ile272Leu variants had specific activities in the range of other pseudodeficiency variants tested. Our findings show that pseudodeficiency and pathogenic variants can be distinguished from each other with regard to specific activity, and confirms that all the pseudodeficiency variants variably reduce α-iduronidase activity. We envision this platform will be a valuable resource for the rigorous assessment of the novel IDUA variants emerging from the expansion of newborn screening efforts.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
10486321,"We report the first missense mutation in the mtDNA gene for subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). The mutation was identified in a 14-year-old boy with a proximal myopathy and lactic acidosis. Muscle histochemistry and mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymology demonstrated a marked reduction in COX activity. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analyses with COX subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies showed a pattern suggestive of a primary mtDNA defect, most likely involving CO II, for COX subunit II (COX II). mtDNA-sequence analysis demonstrated a novel heteroplasmic T-->A transversion at nucleotide position 7,671 in CO II. This mutation changes a methionine to a lysine residue in the middle of the first N-terminal membrane-spanning region of COX II. The immunoblot studies demonstrated a severe reduction in cross-reactivity, not only for COX II but also for the mtDNA-encoded subunit COX III and for nuclear-encoded subunits Vb, VIa, VIb, and VIc. Steady-state levels of the mtDNA-encoded subunit COX I showed a mild reduction, but spectrophotometric analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in COX I-associated heme a3 levels. These observations suggest that, in the COX protein, a structural association of COX II with COX I is necessary to stabilize the binding of heme a3 to COX I.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25185554,"The primary hemostatic von Willebrand factor (vWF) functions to sequester platelets from rheological blood flow and mediates their adhesion to damaged subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. We have surveyed the effect of 16 disease-causing mutations identified in patients diagnosed with the bleeding diathesis disorder, von Willebrand disease (vWD), on the structure and rheology of vWF A1 domain adhesiveness to the platelet GPIbα receptor. These mutations have a dynamic phenotypical range of bleeding from lack of platelet adhesion to severe thrombocytopenia. Using new rheological tools in combination with classical thermodynamic, biophysical, and spectroscopic metrics, we establish a high propensity of the A1 domain to misfold to pathological molten globule conformations that differentially alter the strength of platelet adhesion under shear flow. Rheodynamic analysis establishes a quantitative rank order between shear-rate-dependent platelet-translocation pause times that linearly correlate with clinically reported measures of patient platelet counts and the severity of thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that specific secondary structure elements remaining in these pathological conformations of the A1 domain regulate GPIbα binding and the strength of vWF-platelet interactions, which affects the vWD functional phenotype and the severity of thrombocytopenia.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

27214402,"In human mitochondria, the AUA codon encodes methionine via a mitochondrial transfer RNA for methionine (mt-tRNA(Met)) that contains 5-formylcytidine (f(5)C) at the first position of the anticodon (position 34). f(5)C34 is required for deciphering the AUA codon during protein synthesis. Until now, the biogenesis and physiological role of f(5)C34 were unknown. We demonstrate that biogenesis of f(5)C34 is initiated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent methylation catalyzed by NSUN3, a putative methyltransferase in mitochondria. NSUN3-knockout cells showed strong reduction in mitochondrial protein synthesis and reduced oxygen consumption, leading to deficient mitochondrial activity. We reconstituted formation of 5-methylcytidine (m(5)C) at position 34 (m(5)C34) on mt-tRNA(Met) with recombinant NSUN3 in the presence of AdoMet, demonstrating that NSUN3-mediated m(5)C34 formation initiates f(5)C34 biogenesis. We also found two disease-associated point mutations in mt-tRNA(Met) that impaired m(5)C34 formation by NSUN3, indicating that a lack of f(5)C34 has pathological consequences.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
14597761,"The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 essential subunits of the respiratory chain and has remarkable genetics based on uniparental inheritance. Within human populations, the mitochondrial genome has a high rate of sequence divergence with multiple polymorphic variants and thus has played a major role in examining the evolutionary history of our species. In recent years it has also become apparent that pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations play an important role in neurological and other diseases. Patients harbor many different mtDNA mutations, some of which are mtDNA mutations, some of which are inherited, but others that seem to be sporadic. It has also been suggested that mtDNA mutations play a role in aging and cancer, but the evidence for a causative role in these conditions is less clear. The accumulated data would suggest, however, that mtDNA mutations occur on a frequent basis. In this article we describe a new phenomenon: the accumulation of mtDNA mutations in human colonic crypt stem cells that result in a significant biochemical defect in their progeny. These studies have important consequences not only for understanding of the finding of mtDNA mutations in aging tissues and tumors, but also for determining the frequency of mtDNA mutations within a cell.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
23613869,"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common disease entity among non-dystrophic skeletal muscle congenital diseases. Mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) account for ∼25% of all NM cases and are the most frequent cause of severe forms of NM. So far, the mechanisms underlying muscle weakness in NM patients remain unclear. Additionally, recent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies reported a progressive fatty infiltration of skeletal muscle with a specific muscle involvement in patients with ACTA1 mutations. We investigated strictly noninvasively the gastrocnemius muscle function of a mouse model carrying a mutation in the ACTA1 gene (H40Y). Skeletal muscle anatomy (hindlimb muscles and fat volumes) and energy metabolism were studied using MRI and (31)Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Skeletal muscle contractile performance was investigated while applying a force-frequency protocol (from 1-150 Hz) and a fatigue protocol (80 stimuli at 40 Hz). H40Y mice showed a reduction of both absolute (-40%) and specific (-25%) maximal force production as compared to controls. Interestingly, muscle weakness was associated with an improved resistance to fatigue (+40%) and an increased energy cost. On the contrary, the force frequency relationship was not modified in H40Y mice and the extent of fatty infiltration was minor and not different from the WT group. We concluded that the H40Y mouse model does not reproduce human MRI findings but shows a severe muscle weakness which might be related to an alteration of intrinsic muscular properties. The increased energy cost in H40Y mice might be related to either an impaired mitochondrial function or an alteration at the cross-bridges level. Overall, we provided a unique set of anatomic, metabolic and functional biomarkers that might be relevant for monitoring the progression of NM disease but also for assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions at a preclinical level.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
32695144,"Background: Pathogenic variants in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. Some of these variants can result in incorrect folding of the LDLR protein, which is then accumulated inside the cell and cannot fulfill its function to internalize LDL particles. We analyzed the functional impact of 10 LDLR variants localized in the beta-propeller of epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The experimental part of the work was complemented by a structural analysis on the basis of 3D LDLR protein structure. Methods: T-Rex Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human LDLR gene were used for live cell imaging microscopy, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR analysis. Results: Our results showed that the analyzed LDLR protein variants can be divided into three groups. (1) The variants buried inside the 3D protein structure expressing proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no or reduced plasma membrane localization and LDL particle internalization, and associated with an increased gene expression of ER-resident chaperones. (2) The variants localized on the surface of 3D protein structure with slightly reduced LDLR plasma membrane localization and LDL particle internalization, and associated with no increased mRNA level of ER-resident chaperones. (3) The variants localized on the surface of the 3D protein structure but expressing proteins with cell responses similar to the group 1.

21511053,"The LDL receptor (LDLR) is an endocytic receptor that plays a major role in the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation. During the endocytic process, the LDLR first binds lipoprotein at the cell surface and then traffics to endosomes, where the receptor releases bound lipoprotein. Release is acid-dependent and correlates with the formation of an intramolecular contact within the receptor. Human mutations at residues that form the contact are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and the goal of the present study was to determine the role of contact residues on LDLR function. We show that mutations at nine contact residues reduce the ability of the LDLR to support lipoprotein uptake. Unexpectedly, only four of the mutations (W515A, W541A, H562Y and H586Y) impaired acid-dependent lipoprotein release. The remaining mutations decreased the lipoprotein-binding capacity of the LDLR through either reduction in the number of surface receptors (H190Y, K560W, H562Y and K582W) or reduction in the fraction of surface receptors that were competent to bind lipoprotein (W144A and W193A). We also examined three residues, distal to the contact, which were predicted to be necessary for the LDLR to adopt the acidic conformation. Of the three mutations we tested (G293S, F362A and G375S), one mutation (F362A) reduced lipoprotein uptake. Together, these data suggest that the intramolecular interface plays multiple roles in LDLR function.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

To gain insight into the basis for MPS I, we crystallized human IDUA produced in an Arabidopsis thaliana cgl mutant. IDUA consists of a TIM barrel domain containing the catalytic site, a β-sandwich domain and a fibronectin-like domain. Structures of IDUA bound to iduronate analogs illustrate the Michaelis complex and reveal a (2,5)B conformation in the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, which suggest a retaining double displacement reaction involving the nucleophilic Glu299 and the general acid/base Glu182. Unexpectedly, the N-glycan attached to Asn372 interacts with iduronate analogs in the active site and is required for enzymatic activity.

18535179,"Sarcoglycanopathies are progressive muscle-wasting disorders caused by genetic defects of four proteins, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan, which are elements of a key transmembrane complex of striated muscle. The proper assembly of the sarcoglycan complex represents a critical issue of sarcoglycanopathies, as several mutations severely perturb tetramer formation. Misfolded proteins are generally degraded through the cell's quality-control system; however, this can also lead to the removal of some functional polypeptides. To explore whether it is possible to rescue sarcoglycan mutants by preventing their degradation, we generated a heterologous cell system, based on human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, constitutively expressing three (beta, gamma, and delta) of the four sarcoglycans. In these betagammadelta-HEK cells, the lack of alpha-sarcoglycan prevented complex formation and cell surface localization, wheras the presence of alpha-sarcoglycan allowed maturation and targeting of the tetramer. As in muscles of sarcoglycanopathy patients, transfection of betagammadelta-HEK cells with disease-causing alpha-sarcoglycan mutants led to dramatic reduction of the mutated proteins and the absence of the complex from the cell surface. Proteasomal inhibition reduced the degradation of mutants and facilitated the assembly and targeting of the sarcoglycan complex to the plasma membrane.

Using this platform, we show that the clinically approved drug 4-phenylbutryric acid (4-PBA) partially restores membrane localization to 25 mutations, as well as membrane repair to cultured myotubes expressing 2 different mutations.

37317968,"Genetic testing is essential for patients with a suspected hereditary myopathy. More than 50% of patients clinically diagnosed with a myopathy carry a variant of unknown significance in a myopathy gene, often leaving them without a genetic diagnosis.

Together, β-, α-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan form a 4-protein transmembrane complex (SGC) that localizes to the sarcolemma. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in any subunit can lead to LGMD. To provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of missense variants, we performed deep mutational scanning of SGCB and assessed SGC cell surface localization for all 6,340 possible amino acid changes. Variant functional scores were bimodally distributed and perfectly predicted pathogenicity of known variants. Variants with less severe functional scores more often appeared in patients with slower disease progression, implying a relationship between variant function and disease severity. Amino acid positions intolerant to variation mapped to points of predicted SGC interactions, validated in silico structural models, and enabled accurate prediction of pathogenic variants in other SGC genes.

33692461,"INTRODUCTION: While the acquisition of mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain (KD) has been identified as a common mechanism behind tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance, recent genetic studies have revealed that patients with TKI resistance or intolerance frequently harbor one or more genetic alterations implicated in myeloid malignancies. This suggests that additional mutations other than ABL1 KD mutations might contribute to disease progression.
METHODS: We performed targeted-capture sequencing of 127 known and putative cancer-related genes of 63 patients with CML using next-generation sequencing (NGS), including 42 patients with TKI resistance and 21 with TKI intolerance.
RESULTS: The differences in the number of mutations between groups had no statistical significance. This could be explained in part by not all of the patients having achieved major molecular remission in the early period as expected. Overall, 66 mutations were identified in 96.8% of the patients, most frequently in the KTM2C (31.82%), ABL1 (31.82%), FAT1 (25.76%), and ASXL1 (22.73%) genes. CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 were associated with TKI intolerance, and two of them (CUX1, GATA2) are transcription factors in which mutations were identified in 82.61% of patients with TKI intolerance. ASXL1 mutations were found more frequently in patients with ABL1 KD mutations (38.1% vs 15.21%, P=0.041). Although the number of mutations was low, pairwise interaction between mutated genes showed that ABL1 KD mutations cooccurred with SH2B3 mutations (P&lt;0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, only TET2 mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (P=0.026).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 genes may play important roles in TKI intolerance. ASXL1 and TET2 mutations may be associated with poor patient prognosis. NGS helps improving the clinical risk stratification, which enables the identification of patients with TKI resistance or intolerance in the era of TKI therapy.",PS3_moderate,1,0,,0,
23035049,"The GUCY2D gene encodes retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC1), a key component of the phototransduction machinery in photoreceptors. Mutations in GUCY2D cause Leber congenital amaurosis type 1 (LCA1), an autosomal recessive human retinal blinding disease. The effects of RetGC1 deficiency on human rod and cone photoreceptor structure and function are currently unknown. To move LCA1 closer to clinical trials, we characterized a cohort of patients (ages 6 months-37 years) with GUCY2D mutations. In vivo analyses of retinal architecture indicated intact rod photoreceptors in all patients but abnormalities in foveal cones. By functional phenotype, there were patients with and those without detectable cone vision. Rod vision could be retained and did not correlate with the extent of cone vision or age. In patients without cone vision, rod vision functioned unsaturated under bright ambient illumination. In vitro analyses of the mutant alleles showed that in addition to the major truncation of the essential catalytic domain in RetGC1, some missense mutations in LCA1 patients result in a severe loss of function by inactivating its catalytic activity and/or ability to interact with the activator proteins, GCAPs. The differences in rod sensitivities among patients were not explained by the biochemical properties of the mutants. However, the RetGC1 mutant alleles with remaining biochemical activity in vitro were associated with retained cone vision in vivo. We postulate a relationship between the level of RetGC1 activity and the degree of cone vision abnormality, and argue for cone function being the efficacy outcome in clinical trials of gene augmentation therapy in LCA1.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Vision impairment results when mutations inactivate proteins of the phototransduction cascade. A severe monogenically inherited blindness, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), is caused by mutations in the GUCY2D gene, leading to a molecular defect in the production of cyclic GMP, the second messenger of phototransduction. We studied two patients with GUCY2D-LCA who were undergoing gene augmentation therapy. Both patients had large deficits in rod photoreceptor-based night vision before intervention. Within days of therapy, rod vision in both patients changed dramatically; improvements in visual function and functional vision in these hyper-responding patients reached more than 3 log<sub>10</sub> units (1000-fold), nearing healthy rod vision.

METHODS: GUC2YD cDNA constructs coding for wild-type human (hWT), R1091x, and S248W GUCY2D under the control of the human rhodopsin kinase promoter were expressed in Gucy2e-/-Gucy2f-/- knockout (GCdKO) mouse retinas, which lack endogenous RetGC activity. The constructs were delivered via subretinally injected adenoassociated virus (AAV) vector in one eye, leaving the opposite eye as the non-injected negative control. After testing with electroretinography (ERG), the retinas extracted from the AAV-treated and control eyes were used in guanylyl cyclase activity assays, immunoblotting, and anti-RetGC1 immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Cyclase activity in retinas treated with either hWT or R1091x GUCY2D transgenes was similar but was undetectable in the S248W GUCY2D-treated retinas, which starkly contrasts their relative activities when heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Rod and cone ERGs, absent in GCdKO, appeared in the hWT and R1091x GUCY2D-injected eyes, while the S248W mutant failed to restore scotopic ERG response and enabled only rudimentary photopic ERG response. The hWT and R1091x GUCY2D immunofluorescence was robust in the rod and cone outer segments, whereas the S248W was detectable only in the sparse cone outer segments and sporadic photoreceptor cell bodies. Robust RetGC1 expression was detected with immunoblotting in the hWT and R1091x-treated retinas but was marginal at best in the S248W GUCY2D retinas, despite the confirmed presence of the S248W GUCY2D transcripts.
CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of S248W GUCY2D in living retinas did not correlate with the previously described normal biochemical activity of this mutant when heterologously expressed in non-photoreceptor cell culture. This result suggests that the S248W mutation contributes to LCA1 by hampering the expression, processing, and/or cellular transport of GUCY2D, rather than its enzymatic properties. In contrast, the effective restoration of rod and cone function by R1091x GUCY2D is paradoxical and does not explain the severe loss of vision typical for LCA1 associated with that mutant allele.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
25477517,"One-fifth of all cases of Leber congenital amaurosis are type 1 (LCA1). LCA1 is a severe form of retinal dystrophy caused by loss-of-function mutations in guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1), a key member of the phototransduction cascade involved in modulating the photocurrents. Although GC1 has been studied for some time, the mechanisms responsible for its regulation and membrane targeting are not fully understood. We reported earlier that retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein interacts with GC1 and promotes its targeting to the photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Here, we extend our studies to show a direct association between RD3 and guanylate cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this functional interaction is important for GC1 targeting to POS. We also show that most LCA1-causing mutations in GC1 result in lost GC1 interaction with RD3 or GC1 being targeted to the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that GC1, GCAP1, and RD3 form a complex in the endoplasmic reticulum that targets GC1 to POS. Interruption of this assembly is likely the underlying mechanism for a subset of LCA1.

These mutations correlate with various retinal diseases like autosomal dominant progressive cone degeneration, e.g., Leber Congenital Amaurosis and a juvenile form of retinitis pigmentosa. Wildtype and mutant forms of ROS-GC1 were heterologously expressed in HEK cells, their cellular distribution was investigated and activity profiles in the presence and absence of guanylate cyclase-activating proteins were measured. The mutant P575L was active under all tested conditions, but it displayed a twofold shift in the Ca(2) (+)-sensitivity, whereas the mutant P1069R remained inactive despite normal expression levels. The mutation H1019P caused the cyclase to become more labile. The different biochemical consequences of these mutations seem to reflect the different clinical symptoms. The mutation P575L induces a dysregulation of the Ca(2) (+)-sensitive cyclase activation profile causing a slow progression of the disease by the distortion of the Ca(2) (+)-cGMP homeostasis. In contrast, a strong reduction in cGMP synthesis due to an inactive or structurally unstable ROS-GC1 would trigger more severe forms of retinal diseases.",BS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Interaction with glycoprotein Ibalpha was assessed by testing inhibition of monoclonal antibody LJ-Ib1 binding to platelets and inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation mediated by native vWF. Fragments exposed to pH between 2.5 and 3.5 adopted the molten globule conformation with loosened tertiary structure intermediate between native and completely unordered state. Maximal receptor binding activity was observed when fragments kept at acidic pH, particularly after reduction of the Cys509-Cys695 disulfide bond, were subjected to quick refolding by rapid pH increase. In contrast, slow refolding by incremental pH change over several hours resulted in at least 20-fold lower activity. A specific single point mutation (I546V) resulted in enhanced receptor binding, whereas another mutation (S561G) caused markedly reduced binding.

22517755,"The distinction between mild pathogenic mtDNA mutations and population polymorphisms can be ambiguous because both are homoplasmic, alter conserved functions, and correlate with disease. One possible explanation for this ambiguity is that the same variant may have different consequences in different contexts. The NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) nucleotide 3394 T > C (Y30H) variant is such a case. This variant has been associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and it reduces complex I activity and cellular respiration between 7% and 28% on the Asian B4c and F1 haplogroup backgrounds. However, complex I activity between B4c and F1 mtDNAs, which harbor the common 3394T allele, can also differ by 30%. In Asia, the 3394C variant is most commonly associated with the M9 haplogroup, which is rare at low elevations but increases in frequency with elevation to an average of 25% of the Tibetan mtDNAs (odds ratio = 23.7). In high-altitude Tibetan and Indian populations, the 3394C variant occurs on five different macrohaplogroup M haplogroup backgrounds and is enriched on the M9 background in Tibet and the C4a4 background on the Indian Deccan Plateau (odds ratio = 21.9). When present on the M9 background, the 3394C variant is associated with a complex I activity that is equal to or higher than that of the 3394T variant on the B4c and F1 backgrounds. Hence, the 3394C variant can either be deleterious or beneficial depending on its haplogroup and environmental context. Thus, this mtDNA variant fulfills the criteria for a common variant that predisposes to a ""complex"" disease.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

We identified 19 Taiwanese T2DM and MS pedigrees from Taiwan, with putative matrilineal transmission, one of which harbored the pathogenic mtDNA tRNALeu(UUR) nucleotide (nt) 3243A&gt;G mutation on the N9a3 haplogroup background. We then recruited three independent Taiwanese cohorts, two from Taipei (N = 498, mean age 52 and N = 1002, mean age 44) and one from a non-urban environment (N = 501, mean age 57). All three cohorts were assessed for an array of metabolic parameters, their mtDNA haplogroups determined, and the haplogroups correlated with T2DM/MS phenotypes. Logistic regression analysis revealed that mtDNA haplogroups D5, F4, and N9a conferred T2DM protection, while haplogroups F4 and N9a were risk factors for hypertension (HTN), and F4 was a risk factor for obesity (OB). Additionally, the 5263C&gt;T (ND2 A165V) variant commonly associated with F4 was associated with hypertension (HTN). Cybrids were prepared with macro-haplogroup N (defined by variants m.ND3 10398A (114T) and m.ATP6 8701A (59T)) haplogroups B4 and F1 mtDNAs and from macro-haplogroup M (variants m.ND3 10398G (114A) and m.ATP6 8701G (59A)) haplogroup M9 mtDNAs. Additionally, haplogroup B4 and F1 cybrids were prepared with and without the mtDNA variant in ND1 3394T&gt;C (Y30H) reported to be associated with T2DM. Assay of mitochondria complex I in these cybrids revealed that macro-haplogroup N cybrids had lower activity than M cybrids, that haplogroup F cybrids had lower activity than B4 cybrids, and that the ND1 3394T&gt;C (Y30H) variant reduced complex I on both the B4 and F1 background but with very different cumulative effects.

33398350,"Defects in the posttranscriptional modifications of mitochondrial tRNAs have been linked to human diseases, but their pathophysiology remains elusive. In this report, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying a deafness-associated tRNAIle 4295A>G mutation affecting a highly conserved adenosine at position 37, 3' adjacent to the tRNA's anticodon. Primer extension and methylation activity assays revealed that the m.4295A>G mutation introduced a tRNA methyltransferase 5 (TRMT5)-catalyzed m1G37 modification of tRNAIle. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the m.4295A>G mutation affected tRNAIle structure and function, supported by increased melting temperature, conformational changes and instability of mutated tRNA. An in vitro processing experiment revealed that the m.4295A>G mutation reduced the 5' end processing efficiency of tRNAIle precursors, catalyzed by RNase P. We demonstrated that cybrid cell lines carrying the m.4295A>G mutation exhibited significant alterations in aminoacylation and steady-state levels of tRNAIle. The aberrant tRNA metabolism resulted in the impairment of mitochondrial translation, respiratory deficiency, decreasing membrane potentials and ATP production, increasing production of reactive oxygen species and promoting autophagy. These demonstrated the pleiotropic effects of m.4295A>G mutation on tRNAIle and mitochondrial functions.

8328452,"The mutations underlying Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis IH) in Druze and Muslim Israeli Arab patients have been characterized. Four alleles were identified, using a combination of (a) PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA or genomic DNA segments, (b) cycle sequencing of PCR products, and (c) restriction-enzyme analysis. One allele has two amino acid substitutions, Gly409-->Arg in exon 9 and Ter-->Cys in exon 14. The other three alleles have mutations in exon 2 (Tyr64-->Ter), exon 7 (Gln310-->Ter), or exon 8 (Thr366-->Pro). Transfection of mutagenized cDNAs into Cos-1 cells showed that two missense mutations, Thr366-->Pro and Ter-->Cys, permitted the expression of only trace amounts of alpha-L-iduronidase activity, whereas Gly409-->Arg permitted the expression of 60% as much enzyme as did the normal cDNA. The nonsense mutations were associated with abnormalities of RNA processing: (1) both a very low level of mRNA and skipping of exon 2 for Tyr64-->Ter and (2) utilization of a cryptic splice site for Gln310-->Ter. In all instances, the probands were found homozygous, and the parents heterozygous, for the mutant alleles, as anticipated from the consanguinity in each family. The two-mutation allele was identified in a family from Gaza; the other three alleles were found in seven families, five of them Druze, residing in a very small area of northern Israel.

30763665,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular rare disease characterized by nose and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. HHT shows an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1:5000 individuals. In >80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG (HHT1) or ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes, which code for the membrane proteins Endoglin and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), respectively, both belonging to the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. In this work, we describe a novel mutation in exon 9 of ENG (c.1145 G > A) found in five affected members of a family, all of them with characteristic symptoms of HHT. This mutation involves Cys382 residue of the Endoglin protein (p.Cys382 > Tyr) in the zona pellucida (ZP) module of its extracellular region. This is a critical residue involved in a conserved intrachain disulphide bond and in the correct folding of the protein. In fact, transfection studies in human cells using Endoglin expression vectors demonstrated that the p.Cys382 > Tyr mutation results in a marked reduction in the levels of the Endoglin protein.

39114568,"BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased LDL-cholesterol levels. About 85% of FH cases are caused by LDLR mutations encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). LDLR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it undergoes post-translational modifications and then transported through Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Over 2900 LDLR variants have been reported in FH patients with limited information on the pathogenicity and functionality of many of them. This study aims to elucidate the cellular trafficking and functional implications of LDLR missense variants identified in suspected FH patients using biochemical and functional methods.
METHODS: We used HeLa, HEK293T, and LDLR-deficient-CHO-ldlA7 cells to evaluate the subcellular localization and LDL internalization of ten LDLR missense variants (p.C167F, p.D178N, p.C243Y, p.E277K, p.G314R, p.H327Y, p.D477N, p.D622G, p.R744Q, and p.R814Q) reported in multiethnic suspected FH patients. We also analyzed the functional impact of three variants (p.D445E, p.D482H, and p.C677F), two of which previously shown to be retained in the ER.
RESULTS: We show that p.D622G, p.D482H, and p.C667F are largely retained in the ER whereas p.R744Q is partially retained. The other variants were predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. LDL internalization assays in CHO-ldlA7 cells indicate that p.D482H, p.C243Y, p.D622G, and p.C667F have quantitatively lost their ability to internalize Dil-LDL with the others (p.C167F, p.D178N, p.G314R, p.H327Y, p.D445E, p.D477N, p.R744Q and p.R814Q) showing significant losses except for p.E277K which retained full activity. However, the LDL internalization assay is only to able evaluate the impact of the variants on LDL internalization and not the exact functional defects such as failure to bind LDL. The data represented illustrate the hypomorphism nature of variants causing FH which may explain some of the variable expressivity of FH.

2011604,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) supports platelet adhesion on thrombogenic surfaces by binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib in the GP Ib-IX receptor complex. This interaction is physiologically regulated so that it does not occur between circulating vWF and platelets but, rather, only at a site of vascular injury. The abnormal vWF found in type IIB von Willebrand disease, however, has a characteristically increased affinity for GP Ib and binds to circulating platelets. We have analyzed the molecular basis of this abnormality by sequence analysis of a type IIB vWF cDNA and have identified a single amino acid change, Trp550 to Cys550, located in the GP Ib-binding domain of the molecule comprising residues 449-728. Bacterial expression of recombinant fragments corresponding to this vWF domain yielded molecules that, whether containing a normal Trp550 or a mutant Cys550 residue, bound directly to GP Ib in the absence of modulators and with similar affinity. In contrast, mammalian cell expression of the same segment of sequence yielded molecules that, when containing the normal Trp550, did not bind to GP Ib directly but, like native vWF, bound in the presence of ristocetin. However, molecules containing the point mutation (Cys550) behaved like type IIB vWF--namely, bound to GP Ib even without ristocetin modulation and, in the presence of ristocetin, had 10-fold higher affinity than molecules with normal sequence. These results identify a region of vWF that, although not thought to be directly involved in binding to GP Ib, may modulate the interaction through conformational changes.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Recent data suggest that bezafibrate could improve the FAO capacities in beta-oxidation-deficient cells, by enhancing the residual level of mutant enzyme activity via gene-expression stimulation. Since VLCAD-deficient patients frequently harbor missense mutations with unpredictable effects on enzyme activity, we investigated the response to bezafibrate as a function of genotype in 33 VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts representing 45 different mutations. Treatment with bezafibrate (400 microM for 48 h) resulted in a marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of normal values, for 21 genotypes that mainly corresponded to patients with the myopathic phenotype. In contrast, bezafibrate induced no changes in FAO for 11 genotypes corresponding to severe neonatal or infantile phenotypes. This pattern of response was not due to differential inductions of VLCAD messenger RNA, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, but reflected variable increases in measured VLCAD residual enzyme activity in response to bezafibrate. Genotype cross-analysis allowed the identification of alleles carrying missense mutations, which could account for these different pharmacological profiles and, on this basis, led to the characterization of 9 mild and 11 severe missense mutations. Altogether, the responses to bezafibrate reflected the severity of the metabolic blockage in various genotypes, which appeared to be correlated with the phenotype, thus providing a new approach for analysis of genetic heterogeneity. Finally, this study emphasizes the potential of bezafibrate, a widely prescribed hypolipidemic drug, for the correction of VLCAD deficiency and exemplifies the integration of molecular information in a therapeutic strategy.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of Sug sodium in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block in children. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) for primary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) was calculated for secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: As of 2022-11-03, 18 out of 236 studies included 724 children in the intervention group and 478 children in the control group for meta-analysis. The results showed that compared with the control group, the time required for Train-of-Four Ratio (TOFR) to return to 0.9 and the extubation time were shortened in both 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg of Sug sodium, with statistically significant differences (TOFR ≥0.9: 2 mg/kg: SMD = -2.90; 95%CI: -3.75, -2.04; 4 mg/kg: -3.31; -4.79, -1.84; extubation time: 2 mg/kg: -2.95; -4.04, -1.85; 4 mg/kg: -1.57; -1.90, -1.23). Compared with the control group, the total incidence of adverse effects in the Sug group was lower (RR = 0.44; 0.24,0.82).

Despite this, missense mutations within the B domain have been reported in patients with hemophilia A. Given that the B domain is dispensable for secretion and function of FVIII, we hypothesized that these mutations should not be causative of hemophilia A in these patients.
METHODS:  Plasmid vectors containing B domain missense mutations that were reported to be associated with moderate/severe hemophilia A (T751S, D826E, V993L, H1047Y, T1353A, N1441K, L1462P, E1579D, A1591S, P1641L and S1669L) were analyzed for their effect on synthesis and secretion compared with FVIII wild-type (WT) following transient transfection into COS-1 and CHO cells in vitro. Further, H1047Y, N1441K and E1579D mutants were expressed in vivo in a hemophilia A mouse model by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection.
RESULTS:  FVIII activity and antigen levels for all mutants expressed into the conditioned media of COS-1 and CHO cells were similar to FVIII WT. Also, plasma expression of these mutants was similar to FVIII WT in hemophilia A mice. An in vivo tail clip bleeding assay also demonstrated that blood loss from hemophilia A mice expressing FVIII WT, H1047Y, N1441K and E1579D was similar.

18400783,"Phenotypic diversity associated with pathogenic mutations of the human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) has often been explained by unequal segregation of the mutated and wild-type genomes (heteroplasmy). However, this simple hypothesis cannot explain the tissue specificity of disorders caused by homoplasmic mtDNA mutations. We have previously associated a homoplasmic point mutation (1624C>T) in MTTV with a profound metabolic disorder that resulted in the neonatal deaths of numerous siblings. Affected tissues harboured a marked biochemical defect in components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, presumably due to the extremely low (<1%) steady-state levels of mt-tRNA(Val). In primary myoblasts and transmitochondrial cybrids established from the proband (index case) and offspring, the marked respiratory deficiency was lost and steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA(Val) were greater than in the biopsy material, but were still an order of magnitude lower than in control myoblasts. We present evidence that the generalized decrease in steady-state mt-tRNA(Val) observed in the homoplasmic 1624C>T-cell lines is caused by a rapid degradation of the deacylated form of the abnormal mt-tRNA(Val). By both establishing the identity of the human mitochondrial valyl-tRNA synthetase then inducing its overexpression in transmitochondrial cell lines, we have been able to partially restore steady-state levels of the mutated mt-tRNA(Val), consistent with an increased stability of the charged mt-tRNA.

To date, multiple pathogenic variants in coding regions, splice sites, and deep intronic regions have been revealed. However, there are still pathogenic variants that remain unidentified.
METHODS: Twenty-nine primer pairs flanking exons 2-16 (i.e., coding exons 1-15) of APC and their exon-intron junctions were used for germline pathogenic variant screening in Southern Thai patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Transcription analysis was performed to confirm the pathogenicity of a splice site deletion of intron 10. Family members were interviewed for clinical histories. Blood samples were collected from 18 family members for a segregation study. Subsequently, clinical data of affected members were collected from the hospital databases.
RESULTS: We found a distinct heterozygous 16-bp deletion at the splice donor site of intron 10 leading to a skipping of exon 10 which was confirmed by transcript analysis (APC: c 1312 + 4_1312 + 19del, r.934_1312del). Predictive testing for the pathogenic APC variant in 18 of the proband's family members (ten healthy and eight affected) from three generations showed the same heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in eight affected adult members (15-62 years old) and two children (7 and 10 years old). Seven of the ten carriers of the disease-causing variant had undergone colonoscopy, and colonic polyps were found in all cases, which confirmed the segregation of the inherited pathogenic variant. The phenotypic spectrum was found to vary within the family; and some affected family members exhibited extracolonic manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the pathogenic APC variant, c.1312 + 4_1312 + 19del, r.934_1312del, has not previously been reported.

METHODS: In the current study genomic DNA or RNA from ten unrelated FAP suspected patients was examined for germline mutations in the APC gene. Family history and phenotype were used in order to select the patients. Methods used for testing were dHPLC (denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography), sequencing, MLPA (Multiplex Ligation - dependent Probe Amplification), Karyotyping, FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) and RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction).
RESULTS: A 250 Kbp deletion in the APC gene starting from intron 5 and extending beyond exon 15 was identified in one patient. A substitution of the +5 conserved nucleotide at the splice donor site of intron 9 in the APC gene was shown to produce frameshift and inefficient exon skipping in a second patient.

29851975,"X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal degenerative disorder caused by mutations in RS1 gene leading to splitting of retinal layers (schisis) which impairs visual signal processing. Retinoschisin (RS1) is an adhesive protein which is secreted predominantly by the photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a double-octameric complex. In general, XLRS patients show wide clinical heterogeneity, presenting practical challenges in disease management. Though researchers have attempted various approaches to offer an explanation for clinical heterogeneity, the molecular basis has not been understood yet. Therefore, this study aims at establishing a link between the phenotype and genotype based on the molecular mechanism exerted by the mutations. Twenty seven XLRS patients were enrolled, of which seven harboured novel mutations. The mutant constructs were genetically engineered and their secretion profiles were studied by in vitro cell culture experiments. Based on the secretory profile, the patients were categorized as either secreted or non-secreted group. Various clinical parameters such as visual acuity, location of schisis, foveal thickness and ERG parameters were compared between the two groups and control. Although the two groups showed severe disease phenotype in comparison with control, there was no significant difference between the two XLRS groups. However, the secreted group exhibited relatively severe disease indications. On the other hand molecular analysis suggests that most of the RS1 mutations result in intracellular retention of retinoschisin. Hence, clinical parameters of patients with non-secreted profile were analyzed which in turn revealed wide variability even within the group. Altogether, our results indicate that disease severity is not merely dependent on secretory profile of the mutations. Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
16361673,"BACKGROUND/AIM: X linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is caused by mutations in RS1 which encodes the discoidin domain protein retinoschisin, secreted by photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Missense mutations occur throughout the gene and some of these are known to interfere with protein secretion. This study was designed to investigate the functional consequences of missense mutations at different locations in retinoschisin.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors developed a structural model of the retinoschisin discoidin domain and used this to predict the effects of missense mutations. They expressed disease associated mutations and found that those affecting conserved residues prevented retinoschisin secretion. Most of the remaining mutations cluster within a series of loops on the surface of the beta barrel structure and do not interfere with secretion, suggesting this region may be a ligand binding site. They also demonstrated that wild type retinoschisin octamerises and associates with the cell surface. A subgroup of secreted mutations reduce oligomerisation (C59S, C219G, C223R).
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that there are three different molecular mechanisms which lead to XLRS: mutations interfering with secretion, mutations interfering with oligomerisation, and mutations that allow secretion and oligomerisation but interfere with retinoschisin function.

Our studies, together with molecular modeling of the discoidin domain, identify Cys residues involved in intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds essential for protein folding and subunit assembly. We show that misfolding of the discoidin domain, defective disulfide-linked subunit assembly, and inability of retinoschisin to insert into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as part of the protein secretion process are three primary mechanisms responsible for the loss in the function of retinoschisin as a cell adhesion protein and the pathogenesis of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Over 190 disease-causing mutations in the RS1 gene are known with most mutations occurring as non-synonymous changes in the discoidin domain. Cell expression studies have shown that disease-associated missense mutations in the discoidin domain cause severe protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, mutations in the signal sequence result in aberrant protein synthesis, and mutations in regions flanking the discoidin domain cause defective disulphide-linked subunit assembly, all of which produce a non-functional protein. Knockout mice deficient in retinoschisin have been generated and shown to display most of the characteristic features found in XLRS patients.

RS1 was seen as two stacked rings with each ring displaying a symmetrical cog wheel-like structure with eight teeth or projections corresponding to the RS1 subunits. Three dimensional reconstruction and molecular modelling indicated that the discoidin domain, the principal functional unit of RS1, projects outward, and the Rs1 domain and C-terminal segment containing intermolecular disulphide bonds are present in the inner ring to form the core octameric structure.

There were improvements in gross motor function measure in 9/10 patients, in lingual strength in 6/6 patients, and in pulmonary function in 4/11. Significant reductions in urinary glucose tetrasaccharide, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed at 40 mg/kg weekly compared with lower doses (p < 0.05). No safety or immunogenicity concerns were observed at higher doses.
CONCLUSION: Higher rhGAA doses are safe, improve gross motor outcomes, lingual strength, pulmonary function measures, and biochemical markers in early-onset Pompe disease, and should be considered in patients with clinical and functional decline.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,0,
32518148,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the extent of CNS involvement in children with Pompe disease using brain MRI and developmental assessments.
METHODS: The study included 14 children (ages 6-18 years) with infantile Pompe disease (IPD) (n = 12) or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) (n = 2) receiving enzyme replacement therapy. White matter (WM) hyperintense foci seen in the brain MRIs were systematically quantified using the Fazekas scale (FS) grading system with a novel approach: the individual FS scores from 10 anatomical areas were summed to yield a total FS score (range absent [0] to severe [30]) for each child. The FS scores were compared to developmental assessments of cognition and language obtained during the same time period.
RESULTS: Mild to severe WM hyperintense foci were seen in 10/12 children with IPD (median age 10.6 years) with total FS scores ranging from 2 to 23. Periventricular, subcortical, and deep WM were involved. WM hyperintense foci were seen throughout the path of the corticospinal tracts in the brain in children with IPD. Two children with IPD had no WM hyperintense foci. Children with IPD had relative weaknesses in processing speed, fluid reasoning, visual perception, and receptive vocabulary. The 2 children with LOPD had no WM hyperintense foci, and high scores on most developmental assessments.
CONCLUSION: This study systematically characterized WM hyperintense foci in children with IPD, which could serve as a benchmark for longitudinal follow-up of WM abnormalities in patients with Pompe disease and other known neurodegenerative disorders or leukodystrophies in children.",PS3_supporting,1,0,,0,
23213406,"Mutations affecting the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1) interactome cause syndromic retinal dystrophies. RPGRIP1 interacts with the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) through a domain homologous to RCC1 (RHD), a nucleotide exchange factor of Ran GTPase. However, functional relationships between RPGR and RPGRIP1 and their subcellular roles are lacking. We show by molecular modeling and analyses of RPGR disease-mutations that the RPGR-interacting domain (RID) of RPGRIP1 embraces multivalently the shared RHD of RPGR(1-19) and RPGR(ORF15) isoforms and the mutations are non-overlapping with the interface found between RCC1 and Ran GTPase. RPGR disease-mutations grouped into six classes based on their structural locations and differential impairment with RPGRIP1 interaction. RPGRIP1α(1) expression alone causes its profuse self-aggregation, an effect suppressed by co-expression of either RPGR isoform before and after RPGRIP1α(1) self-aggregation ensue. RPGR(1-19) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas RPGR(ORF15) presents cytosolic distribution and they determine uniquely the subcellular co-localization of RPGRIP1α(1). Disease mutations in RPGR(1) (-19), RPGR(ORF15), or RID of RPGRIP1α(1), singly or in combination, exert distinct effects on the subcellular targeting, co-localization or tethering of RPGRIP1α(1) with RPGR(1-19) or RPGR(ORF15) in kidney, photoreceptor and hepatocyte cell lines. Additionally, RPGR(ORF15), but not RPGR(1-19), protects the RID of RPGRIP1α(1) from limited proteolysis. These studies define RPGR- and cell-type-dependent targeting pathways with structural and functional plasticity modulating the expression of mutations in RPGR and RPGRIP1. Further, RPGR isoforms distinctively determine the subcellular targeting of RPGRIP1α(1,) with deficits in RPGR(ORF15)-dependent intracellular localization of RPGRIP1α(1) contributing to pathomechanisms shared by etiologically distinct syndromic retinal dystrophies.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
30622176,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disease with severe vision impairment leading to blindness. About 10-15% of RP cases are caused by mutations in the RPGR gene, with RPGR mutations accounting for 70% of X-linked RP cases. The mechanism by which RPGR mutations cause photoreceptor cell dysfunction is not well understood. In this study, we show that the two isoforms of RPGR (RPGR1-19 and RPGRORF15) interact with endogenous PDE6D, INPP5E, and RPGRIP1L. The RPGR1-19 isoform contains two PDE6D binding sites with the C-terminal prenylation site being the predominant PDE6D binding site. The C terminus of RPGR1-19 that contains the prenylation site regulates its interaction with PDE6D, INPP5E, and RPGRIP1L. Only the RPGR1-19 isoform localizes to cilia in cultured RPE1 cells. Missense variations found in RPGR patients disrupt the interaction between RPGR isoforms and their endogenous interactors INPP5E, PDE6D, and RPGRIP1L. We evaluated a RPGR missense variation (M58K) found in a family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and show that this missense variation disrupts the interaction of RPGR isoforms with their endogenous interactors. The M58K variation also disrupts the ciliary localization of the RPGR1-19 isoform. Using this assay, we also show that some of the RPGR missense variants reported in the literature might not actually be disease causing.

35659930,"BRCA1 is a high-risk susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer. Pathogenic protein-truncating variants are scattered across the open reading frame, but all known missense substitutions that are pathogenic because of missense dysfunction are located in either the amino-terminal RING domain or the carboxy-terminal BRCT domain. Heterodimerization of the BRCA1 and BARD1 RING domains is a molecularly defined obligate activity. Hence, we tested every BRCA1 RING domain missense substitution that can be created by a single nucleotide change for heterodimerization with BARD1 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Downstream of the laboratory assay, we addressed three additional challenges: assay calibration, validation thereof, and integration of the calibrated results with other available data, such as computational evidence and patient/population observational data to achieve clinically applicable classification. Overall, we found that 15%-20% of BRCA1 RING domain missense substitutions are pathogenic. Using a Bayesian point system for data integration and variant classification, we achieved clinical classification of 89% of observed missense substitutions. Moreover, among missense substitutions not present in the human observational data used here, we find an additional 45 with concordant computational and functional assay evidence in favor of pathogenicity plus 223 with concordant evidence in favor of benignity; these are particularly likely to be classified as likely pathogenic and likely benign, respectively, once human observational data become available.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

While more than 4,000 unique VUSs, comprised of missense or intronic variants, have been identified in BRCA2, the few missense variants now classified clinically as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are predominantly located in the region encoding the C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD). We report on functional evaluation of the influence of 462 BRCA2 missense variants affecting the DBD on DNA repair activity of BRCA2 using a homology-directed DNA double-strand break repair assay. Of these, 137 were functionally abnormal, 313 were functionally normal, and 12 demonstrated intermediate function. Comparisons with other functional studies of BRCA2 missense variants yielded strong correlations. Sequence-based in silico prediction models had high sensitivity, but limited specificity, relative to the homology-directed repair assay. Combining the functional results with clinical and genetic data in an American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)-like variant classification framework from a clinical testing laboratory, after excluding known splicing variants and functionally intermediate variants, classified 431 of 442 (97.5%) missense variants (129 as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 302 as benign/likely benign). Functionally abnormal variants classified as pathogenic by ACMG/AMP rules were associated with a slightly lower risk of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 5.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.43-7.83) than BRCA2 DBD protein truncating variants (OR 8.56, 95% CI 6.03-12.36).

However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign.

Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance2-4 (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15-26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479-3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs.

We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants of high-and moderate-risk genes using a 23-gene germline cancer panel in 518 patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (HBOC). The frequency of P/LP variants was 12.4% (64/518) for high- and moderate-penetrant genes, namely, BRCA2 (5.6%), BRCA1 (3.3%), CHEK2 (1.2%), MUTYH (0.8%), PALB2 (0.8%), MLH1 (0.4%), ATM (0.4%), BRIP1 (0.4%), TP53 (0.2%), and PMS2 (0.2%).

We also compared the results from in silico splicing predictive tools and exon splicing patterns from patient samples by analyzing RT-PCR product sequences in six P/LP intronic variants and two intronic variants of unknown significance (VUS). Altered transcriptional fragments were detected for P/LP intronic variants in BRCA1, BRIP1, CHEK2, PARB2, and PMS2. Notably, we identified an in-frame deletion of the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain by exon skipping in BRCA1 c.5152+6T>C-as known VUS-indicating a risk for HBOC.

Both presented with distinctive phenotype including corneal clouding.
METHODS: The entire coding regions of the α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Functional characterization of the mutant IDUA was determined by transient transfection of the construct into COS-7 cells.
RESULTS: Mutation analyses revealed that the MPS IH patient was homozygous for a previously reported mutation, c.252insC, while the MPS IS patient was found to harbor a novel c.826G>A (p.E276K) mutation. The novel p.E276K mutation was not detected in 100 unaffected ethnic-matched control chromosomes. In addition, the glutamic acid residue at codon 276 was located at a well conserved residue.

Numerous mutations in the mitochondrial gene ND1 have been identified in humans. Currently, a bacterial model system provides the only method for rapid construction and analysis of mutations in homologs of human ND1. In this report, we have identified nine mutations in human ND1 that are reported to be pathogenic and are located at subunit interfaces. Our hypothesis was that these mutations would disrupt Complex I assembly. Seventeen mutations were constructed in the homologous nuoH gene in an E. coli model system. In addition to the clinical mutations, alanine substitutions were constructed in order to distinguish between a deleterious effect from the introduction of the mutant residue and the loss of the original residue. The mutations were moved to an expression vector containing all thirteen genes of the E. coli nuo operon coding for Complex I. Membrane vesicles were prepared and rates of deamino-NADH oxidase activity and proton translocation were measured. Samples were also tested for assembly by native gel electrophoresis and for expression of NuoH by immunoblotting. A range of outcomes was observed: Mutations at four of the sites allow normal assembly with moderate activity (50−76% of wild type). Mutations at the other sites disrupt assembly and/or activity, and in some cases the outcomes depend upon the amino acid introduced. In general, the outcomes are consistent with the proposed pathogenicity in humans.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
20926450,"Somatic and germline mutations in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) are found in sporadic cancers and Cowden syndrome patients, respectively. Recent identification of naturally occurring cancer and germline mutations within the ATP-binding motifs of PTEN (heretofore referred to as PTEN ATP-binding mutations) has revealed that these mutations disrupted the subcellular localization and tumor-suppressor activity of PTEN. However, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms of PTEN ATP-binding mutations in tumorigenesis. Here we show that these mutations impair PTEN's function both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the one hand, PTEN ATP-binding mutants lose their phosphatase activity and the effect of downregulation of cyclin D1. On the other, the mislocalized mutant PTEN results in a significantly decreased nuclear p53 protein level and transcriptional activity, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, induction of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase as well as dramatically increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). When compared with wild-type PTEN, the ATP-binding mutant PTEN has reduced half-life in vitro and decreased protein expression levels in vivo. Our data, thus, reveal a novel mechanism of tumorigenesis in patients with germline or somatic mutations affecting PTEN ATP-binding motifs, i.e. qualitative and quantitative impairment of PTEN due to the loss of its phosphatase activity, and nuclear mislocalization, resulting in rapid PTEN protein degradation, suppression of p53-mediated transcriptional activity, loss of protection against oxidative stress as well as accumulation of spontaneous DNA DSBs.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

In addition to being mutated in the germline in PHTS, somatic loss-of-function PTEN mutations are seen in a wide range of sporadic human tumors. Here, we show evidence of upregulated proteasome activity in PHTS-derived lymphoblasts, Pten knock-in mice and cell lines expressing missense and nonsense PTEN mutations. Notably, elevated nuclear proteasome activity occurred in cells expressing the nuclear mislocalized PTEN-K62R mutant, whereas elevated cytosolic proteasome activity was observed in cells expressing the cytosolic-predominant mutant PTEN (M3M4 and C136R). Treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was able to restore both nonsense and missense mutant PTEN protein levels in vitro. PHTS patients with destabilizing PTEN mutations and proteasome hyperactivity are more susceptible to develop neurologic symptoms such as mental retardation and autism than mutation-positive patients with normal proteasome activity. A detailed molecular and functional analysis shows that PTEN mutants most likely cause proteasome hyperactivity via 2 different mechanisms, namely, induction of proteotoxic stress and loss of protein phosphatase activity. These results provide novel insights into the cellular functions of PTEN and reveal molecular mechanisms whereby PTEN mutations increase proteasome activity and lead to neurologic phenotypes.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Biochemical analyses of skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed an isolated and extremely low activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). This finding was confirmed by enzyme histochemistry, which demonstrated an almost complete absence of fibers with normal COX activity. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a single base-pair deletion (m.8088delT) in MT-CO2, which encodes subunit 2 of COX, resulting in a premature stop codon. Restriction fragment length polymorphism-analysis confirmed mtDNA heteroplasmy with high mutant load in skeletal muscle, the only clinically affected tissue, but low levels in other investigated tissues.

In this update, we present the disease-causing variants in NEB in 159 families, 143 families with NM, and 16 families with NM-related myopathies. Eighty-eight families are presented here for the first time. We summarize 86 previously published and 126 unpublished variants identified in NEB. Furthermore, we have analyzed the NEB variants deposited in the Exome Variant Server (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), identifying that pathogenic variants are a minor fraction of all coding variants (∼7%). This indicates that nebulin tolerates substantial changes in its amino acid sequence, providing an explanation as to why variants in such a large gene result in relatively rare disorders.

Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy.

METHODS: We analyzed all known potentially pathogenic CDKL5 variants by combining data from large-scale population sequencing studies with CDKL5 variants from new and all available clinical cohorts and combined this with computational methods to predict pathogenicity.
RESULTS: The study has identified several variants that can be reclassified as benign or likely benign. With the addition of novel CDKL5 variants, we confirm that pathogenic missense variants cluster in the catalytic domain of CDKL5 and reclassify a purported missense variant as having a splicing consequence. We provide further evidence that missense variants in the final 3 exons are likely to be benign and not important to disease pathology. We also describe benign splicing and nonsense variants within these exons, suggesting that isoform hCDKL5_5 is likely to have little or no neurologic significance. We also use the available data to make a preliminary estimate of minimum incidence of CDKL5 deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for genetic diagnosis, providing evidence for the reclassification of specific variants previously thought to result in CDKL5 deficiency. Together, these analyses support the view that the predominant brain isoform in humans (hCDKL5_1) is crucial for normal neurodevelopment and that the catalytic domain is the primary functional domain.",PS3_supporting,1,0,,0,

The isomerase, which converts an all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, has never been identified. Here, we performed an unbiased cDNA expression screen to identify this isomerase. We discovered that the isomerase is a previously characterized protein called Rpe65. We confirmed our identification of the isomerase by demonstrating catalytic activity in mammalian and insect cells that express Rpe65. Mutations in the human RPE65 gene cause a blinding disease of infancy called Leber congenital amaurosis. Rpe65 with the Leber-associated C330Y and Y368H substitutions had no isomerase activity.

29451064,"Inactivation is an intrinsic property of numerous voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels and can occur by N-type or/and C-type mechanisms. N-type inactivation is a fast, voltage independent process, coupled to activation, with each inactivation particle of a tetrameric channel acting independently. In N-type inactivation, a single inactivation particle is necessary and sufficient to occlude the pore. C-type inactivation is a slower process, involving the outermost region of the pore and is mediated by a concerted, highly cooperative interaction between all four subunits. Inactivation of Kv7.1 channels does not exhibit the hallmarks of N- and C-type inactivation. Inactivation of WT Kv7.1 channels can be revealed by hooked tail currents that reflects the recovery from a fast and voltage-independent inactivation process. However, several Kv7.1 mutants such as the pore mutant L273F generate an additional voltage-dependent slow inactivation. The subunit interactions during this slow inactivation gating remain unexplored. The goal of the present study was to study the nature of subunit interactions along Kv7.1 inactivation gating, using concatenated tetrameric Kv7.1 channel and introducing sequentially into each of the four subunits the slow inactivating pore mutation L273F. Incorporating an incremental number of inactivating mutant subunits did not affect the inactivation kinetics but slowed down the recovery kinetics from inactivation. Results indicate that Kv7.1 inactivation gating is not compatible with a concerted cooperative process. Instead, adding an inactivating subunit L273F into the Kv7.1 tetramer incrementally stabilizes the inactivated state, which suggests that like for activation gating, Kv7.1 slow inactivation gating is not a concerted process.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

It is also well known that accompanying KCNQ1 channel opening, the ionic current is suppressed by a rapid process called inactivation. Here we show that inactivation of KCNQ1 channels derives from the different mechanisms of the VSD-pore coupling that lead to the IO and AO states, respectively. When the VSD activates from the intermediate state to the activated state, the VSD-pore coupling has less efficacy in opening the pore, producing inactivation.

However, interpreting results from genetic testing is confounded by the presence of variants of unknown significance for which there is inadequate evidence of pathogenicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we curated from the literature a high-quality set of 107 functionally characterized KCNQ1 variants. Based on this data set, we completed a detailed quantitative analysis on the sequence conservation patterns of subdomains of KCNQ1 and the distribution of pathogenic variants therein. We found that conserved subdomains generally are critical for channel function and are enriched with dysfunctional variants. Using this experimentally validated data set, we trained a neural network, designated Q1VarPred, specifically for predicting the functional impact of KCNQ1 variants of unknown significance. The estimated predictive performance of Q1VarPred in terms of Matthew's correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.581 and 0.884, respectively, superior to the performance of 8 previous methods tested in parallel. Q1VarPred is publicly available as a web server at http://meilerlab.org/q1varpred.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a plethora of tools are available for making pathogenicity predictions over a genome-wide scale, previous tools fail to perform in a robust manner when applied to KCNQ1. The contrasting and favorable results for Q1VarPred suggest a promising approach, where a machine-learning algorithm is tailored to a specific protein target and trained with a functionally validated data set to calibrate informatics tools.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
11278406,"KCNQ1 inactivation bears electrophysiological characteristics different from classical N- and C-type inactivation in Shaker-like potassium channels. However, the molecular site of KCNQ1 inactivation has not yet been determined. KCNQ2 channels do not exert a fast inactivation in contrast to KCNQ1 channels. By expressing functional chimeras between KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 in Xenopus oocytes, we mapped the region of this inactivation to transmembrane domain S5 and the pore loop H5 and finally narrowed down the site to positions Gly(272) and Val(307) in KCNQ1. Exchanging these two amino acids individually with the analogous KCNQ2 residue abolished inactivation. Furthermore, a KCNQ1-like inactivation was introduced into KCNQ2 by mutagenesis in the corresponding region, confirming its relevance for the inactivation process. As KCNQ1 inactivation involves the regions S5 and H5, it exhibits a geography distinct from N- or C-type inactivation. Native cardiac I(Ks) channels comprising KCNQ1 and accessory MinK subunits do not inactivate because of the functional interaction of KCNQ1 with MinK. Mutations in KCNQ1 can lead to long QT1 syndrome, an inherited form of arrhythmia. The long QT1 mutant KCNQ1(L273F) displays a pronounced KCNQ1 inactivation. Here we show that when expressing mutant I(Ks) channels formed from KCNQ1(L273F) and MinK, MinK association no longer eliminates KCNQ1 inactivation. This results in smaller repolarizing currents in the heart and therefore represents a novel mechanism leading to long QT syndrome.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study sample comprised 860 patients with genetically confirmed mutations in the KCNQ1 channel. Patients were categorized into carriers of missense mutations located in the cytoplasmic loops (C loops), membrane-spanning domain, C/N terminus, and nonmissense mutations. There were 27 aborted cardiac arrest and 78 sudden cardiac death events from birth through 40 years of age. After multivariable adjustment for clinical factors, the presence of C-loop mutations was associated with the highest risk for aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death (hazard ratio versus nonmissense mutations=2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-5.86; P=0.009). β-Blocker therapy was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the risk of aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death among patients with C-loop mutations than among all other patients (hazard ratio=0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.73; P=0.02; and hazard ratio=0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-2.13; P=0.68, respectively; P for interaction=0.04). Cellular expression studies showed that membrane spanning and C-loop mutations produced a similar decrease in current, but only C-loop mutations showed a pronounced reduction in channel activation in response to β-adrenergic stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with C-loop missense mutations in the KCNQ1 channel exhibit a high risk for life-threatening events and derive a pronounced benefit from treatment with β-blockers.

For disorders caused by mutations in cardiac ion channels as in congenital arrhythmia syndromes, in vitro electrophysiological evidence has high value in discriminating pathogenic from benign variants, but these data are often lacking because assays are cost, time, and labor intensive.
METHODS: We implemented a strategy for performing high-throughput functional evaluations of ion channel variants that repurposed an automated electrophysiological recording platform developed previously for drug discovery.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the success of this approach by evaluating 78 variants in KCNQ1, a major gene involved in genetic disorders of cardiac arrhythmia susceptibility. We benchmarked our results with traditional electrophysiological approaches and observed a high level of concordance. This strategy also enabled studies of dominant-negative behavior of variants exhibiting severe loss-of-function. Overall, our results provided functional data useful for reclassifying >65% of the studied KCNQ1 variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate an efficient and high-throughput paradigm linking genotype to function for a human cardiac ion channel that will enable data-driven classification of large numbers of variants and create new opportunities for precision medicine.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
17999538,"Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial potassium channels and the closed state model for Kv1.2 of Yarov-Yarovoy et al. ((2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 7292-7207). Using the new models for KCNQ1, we generated a database for the location and predicted residue-residue interactions for more than 85 disease-linked sites in both open and closed states. These data can be used to generate structure-based hypotheses for disease phenotypes associated with each mutation. The potential utility of these models and the database is exemplified by the surprising observation that four of the five known mutations in KCNQ1 that are associated with gain-of-function KCNQ1 defects are predicted to share a common interface in the open state structure between the S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit. This interface evidently plays an important role in channel gating.",PS3_strong,1,0,,0,
25344363,"AIMS: Long QT syndrome 1 (LQT1) mutations in KCNQ1 that decrease cardiac IKs (slowly activating delayed rectifier K(+) current) underlie ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. LQT1 mutations may suppress IKs by preventing KCNQ1 assembly, disrupting surface trafficking, or inhibiting gating. We investigated mechanisms underlying how three LQT1 mutations in KCNQ1 C-terminus assembly domain (R555H/G589D/L619M) decrease IKs in heterologous cells and cardiomyocytes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mutant KCNQ1 + KCNE1 channels either produced no currents (G589D/L619M) or displayed markedly reduced IKs with a right-shifted voltage-dependence of activation (R555H). When co-expressed with wild-type (wt) KCNQ1, the mutant KCNQ1s displayed varying intrinsic dominant-negative capacities that were affected by auxiliary KCNE1. All three mutant KCNQ1s assembled with wt KCNQ1 as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We developed an optical quantum dot labelling assay to measure channel surface density. G589D/R555H displayed substantial reductions in surface density, which were either partially (G589D) or fully (R555H) rescued by wt KCNQ1. Unexpectedly, L619M showed no trafficking defect. In adult rat cardiomyocytes, adenovirus-expressed homotetrameric G589D/L619M + KCNE1 channels yielded no currents, whereas R555H + KCNE1 produced diminished IKs with a right-shifted voltage-dependence of activation, mimicking observations in CHO cells. In contrast to heterologous cells, homotetrameric R555H channels showed no trafficking defect in cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSION: Distinct LQT1 mutations in KCNQ1 assembly domain decrease IKs using unique combinations of biophysical and trafficking mechanisms. Functional deficits in IKs observed in heterologous cells are mostly, but not completely, recapitulated in adult rat cardiomyocytes. A 'methodological chain' combining approaches in heterologous cells and cardiomyocytes provides mechanistic insights that may help advance personalized therapy for LQT1 mutations.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
36674868,"The KCNQ1 gene encodes the α-subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel KCNQ1, also denoted as Kv7.1 or KvLQT1. The channel assembles with the ß-subunit KCNE1, also known as minK, to generate the slowly activating cardiac delayed rectifier current I<sub>Ks</sub>, a key regulator of the heart rate dependent adaptation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). Loss-of-function variants in KCNQ1 cause the congenital Long QT1 (LQT1) syndrome, characterized by delayed cardiac repolarization and a QT interval prolongation in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Autosomal dominant loss-of-function variants in KCNQ1 result in the LQT syndrome called Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), while autosomal recessive variants affecting function, lead to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), associated with deafness. The aim of this study was the characterization of novel KCNQ1 variants identified in patients with RWS to widen the spectrum of known LQT1 variants, and improve the interpretation of the clinical relevance of variants in the KCNQ1 gene. We functionally characterized nine human KCNQ1 variants using the voltage-clamp technique in Xenopus laevis oocytes, from which we report seven novel variants. The functional data was taken as input to model surface ECGs, to subsequently compare the functional changes with the clinically observed QTc times, allowing a further interpretation of the severity of the different LQTS variants. We found that the electrophysiological properties of the variants correlate with the severity of the clinically diagnosed phenotype in most cases, however, not in all. Electrophysiological studies combined with in silico modelling approaches are valuable components for the interpretation of the pathogenicity of KCNQ1 variants, but assessing the clinical severity demands the consideration of other factors that are included, for example in the Schwartz score.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Recently, we showed that function of mutant GAA in fibroblasts derived from Pompe disease patient carrying c.546G>T mutation is improved by treatment with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as well as pharmacological chaperone (PC). However, bortezomib-responsive GAA mutations are not fully characterized. In this study, we showed the effect of bortezomib on different mutants of GAA in patient fibroblasts and transiently expressed HEK293T cells. Bortezomib increased the maturation and residual activity of GAA in patient fibroblasts carrying PC-responsive M519V and PC-unresponsive C647W mutations. Enhanced colocalization of GAA with lysosomal marker LAMP2 was also observed in patient fibroblasts after treatment with bortezomib. When four distinct mutant GAAs, which show different response to PC, were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, bortezomib improved the activity of M519V, S529V, and C647W in them (1.3-5.9-fold).

We studied the effects of two imino sugars, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), on residual GAA activity in fibroblasts from eight patients with different forms of Pompe disease (two classic infantile, two non-classic infantile onset, four late-onset forms), and with different mutations of the GAA gene. We demonstrated a significant increase of GAA activity (1.3-7.5-fold) after imino sugar treatment in fibroblasts from patients carrying the mutations L552P (three patients) and G549R (one patient). GAA enhancement was confirmed in HEK293T cells where the same mutations were overexpressed. No increase of GAA activity was observed for the other mutations. Western blot analysis showed that imino sugars increase the amount of mature GAA molecular forms. Immunofluorescence studies in HEK293T cells overexpressing the L552P mutation showed an improved trafficking of the mutant enzyme to lysosomes after imino sugar treatment.

Both mitochondrial tRNA mutations were almost homoplasmic in fibroblasts and muscle tissue of the two patients and not present in controls. Patient fibroblasts showed a general mitochondrial translation defect. The mutations resulted in lowered steady-state levels and altered conformations of the tRNAs. Cybrid cell lines showed similar tRNA defects and impairment of OXPHOS complex assembly as patient fibroblasts. Our results show that these tRNA(Trp) and tRNA(Arg) mutations cause the combined OXPHOS deficiencies in the patients, adding to the still expanding group of pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
33273586,"The reverse two-hybrid system is a powerful method to select mutations that disrupt the interaction between two proteins and therefore to identify the residues involved in this interaction. However, the usefulness of this technique has been limited by its relative complexity when compared to the classical two-hybrid system, since an additional selection step is required to eliminate the high background of uninformative truncation mutants. We have developed a new method that combines the classical and reverse two-hybrid systems to select loss-of-binding missense mutations in a single step. The strategy used to select against truncation mutants is based on the two-hybrid interaction between a C-terminal fusion peptide and the Tsg101 protein. We have applied this method to identify mutations in human glucokinase (GK) that disrupt glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) binding. Our results indicate that this method is very efficient and eliminates all the truncation mutants and false positives. The mutated residues identified in GK are involved in the GKRP binding interface or in stabilizing the super-open conformation of GK that binds GKRP. This technique offers an improvement over existing methods in terms of speed, efficiency and simplicity and can be used to study any detectable protein interaction in the two-hybrid system.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
33314489,"The discovery of high-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes, such as Breast cancer associated gene 1 (BRCA1) and Breast cancer associated gene 2 (BRCA2) has led to accurate identification of individuals for risk management and targeted therapy. The rapid decline in sequencing costs has tremendously increased the number of individuals who are undergoing genetic testing world-wide. However, given the significant differences in population-specific variants, interpreting the results of these tests can be challenging especially for novel genetic variants in understudied populations. Here we report the characterization of novel variants in the Malaysian and Singaporean population that consist of different ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese, Indian, and other indigenous groups). We have evaluated the functional significance of 14 BRCA2 variants of uncertain clinical significance by using multiple in silico prediction tools and examined their frequency in a cohort of 7840 breast cancer cases and 7928 healthy controls. In addition, we have used a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based functional assay to assess the impact of these variants on BRCA2 function. We found these variants to be functionally indistinguishable from wild-type BRCA2. These variants could fully rescue the lethality of Brca2-null mESCs and exhibited no sensitivity to six different DNA damaging agents including a poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor. Our findings strongly suggest that all 14 evaluated variants are functionally neutral. Our findings should be valuable in risk assessment of individuals carrying these variants.",BS3_strong,1,1,,1,
37713444,"The unknown pathogenicity of a significant number of variants found in cancer-related genes is attributed to limited epidemiological data, resulting in their classification as variant of uncertain significance (VUS). To date, Breast Cancer gene-2 (BRCA2) has the highest number of VUSs, which has necessitated the development of several robust functional assays to determine their functional significance. Here we report the use of a humanized-mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line expressing a single copy of the human BRCA2 for a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput functional assay. As a proof-of-principle, we have saturated 11 codons encoded by BRCA2 exons 3, 18, 19 and all possible single-nucleotide variants in exon 13 and multiplexed these variants for their functional categorization. Specifically, we used a pool of 180-mer single-stranded donor DNA to generate all possible combination of variants. Using a high throughput sequencing-based approach, we show a significant drop in the frequency of non-functional variants, whereas functional variants are enriched in the pool of the cells. We further demonstrate the response of these variants to the DNA-damaging agents, cisplatin and olaparib, allowing us to use cellular survival and drug response as parameters for variant classification. Using this approach, we have categorized 599 BRCA2 variants including 93-single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the 11 codons, of which 28 are reported in ClinVar. We also functionally categorized 252 SNVs from exon 13 into 188 functional and 60 non-functional variants, demonstrating that saturation genome editing (SGE) coupled with drug sensitivity assays can enhance functional annotation of BRCA2 VUS.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,

Functional assays can be used to experimentally assess the effects of these variants. In this study, we used multiplexed DNA repair assays of variants in the BRCA1 carboxyl terminus to functionally characterize 2,271 variants for homology-directed repair function (HDR) and 1,427 variants for cisplatin resistance (CR). We found a high level of consistent results (Pearson's r = 0.74) in the two multiplexed functional assays with non-functional variants located within regions of the BRCA1 protein necessary for its tumor suppression activity. In addition, functional categorizations of variants tested in the multiplex HDR and CR assays correlated with known clinical significance and with other functional assays for BRCA1 (Pearson's r = 0.53 to 0.71).

This mutation may account for the FA phenotype in a patient originally reported to have biallelic mutations in BRCA2. Subsequent functional studies revealed that one of the mutations, K2729N, was a neutral change. As reported here, a more careful analysis resulted in the identification of a novel splice site mutation. Functional analysis using a mouse embryonic stem cell-based assay revealed that it causes aberrant splicing, reduced transcript levels and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, suggesting that it is likely to be pathogenic. Although similar pathogenic variants in the noncoding region of BRCA1 and 2 were not identified in a cohort of 752 familial breast cancer cases, we still think this finding is relevant for mutation analysis in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome families in a diagnostic setting.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
20631154,"Defects in biogenesis or function(s) of primary cilia are associated with numerous inherited disorders (called ciliopathies) that may include retinal degeneration phenotype. The cilia-expressed gene RPGR (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator) is mutated in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and encodes multiple protein isoforms with a common N-terminal domain homologous to regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ran GTPase. RPGR interacts with several ciliopathy proteins, such as RPGRIP1L and CEP290; however, its physiological role in cilia-associated functions has not been delineated. Here, we report that RPGR interacts with the small GTPase RAB8A, which participates in cilia biogenesis and maintenance. We show that RPGR primarily associates with the GDP-bound form of RAB8A and stimulates GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange. Disease-causing mutations in RPGR diminish its interaction with RAB8A and reduce the GEF activity. Depletion of RPGR in hTERT-RPE1 cells interferes with ciliary localization of RAB8A and results in shorter primary cilia. Our data suggest that RPGR modulates intracellular localization and function of RAB8A. We propose that perturbation of RPGR-RAB8A interaction, at least in part, underlies the pathogenesis of photoreceptor degeneration in XLRP caused by RPGR mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Patients with the severe type of the disease, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), show generalized muscle weakness and heart failure in early infancy. They cannot survive over two years. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves the survival rate, but its effect on skeletal muscle is insufficient compared to other organs. Moreover, the patho-mechanism of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD is still unclear. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with IOPD and differentiated them into myocytes. Differentiated myocytes showed lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which was dose-dependently rescued by rhGAA. We further demonstrated that mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity was impaired in IOPD iPSC-derived myocytes. Comprehensive metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested the disturbance of mTORC1-related signaling, including deteriorated energy status and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative function. In summary, we successfully established an in vitro skeletal muscle model of IOPD using patient-specific iPSCs. Disturbed mTORC1 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD, and may be a potential therapeutic target for Pompe disease.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Disease-causing mutations have been reported in five genes, each encoding a protein component of the sarcomeric thin filament. Recently, we identified mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal-actin gene (ACTA1) in a subset of patients with NM. In the present study, we evaluated a new series of 35 patients with NM. We identified five novel missense mutations in ACTA1, which suggested that mutations in muscle alpha-skeletal actin account for the disease in approximately 15% of patients with NM. The mutations appeared de novo and represent new dominant mutations. One proband subsequently had two affected children, a result consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. The seven patients exhibited marked clinical variability, ranging from severe congenital-onset weakness, with death from respiratory failure during the 1st year of life, to a mild childhood-onset myopathy, with survival into adulthood. There was marked variation in both age at onset and clinical severity in the three affected members of one family. Common pathological features included abnormal fiber type differentiation, glycogen accumulation, myofibrillar disruption, and ""whorling"" of actin thin filaments. The percentage of fibers with rods did not correlate with clinical severity; however, the severe, lethal phenotype was associated with both severe, generalized disorganization of sarcomeric structure and abnormal localization of sarcomeric actin. The marked variability, in clinical phenotype, among patients with different mutations in ACTA1 suggests that both the site of the mutation and the nature of the amino acid change have differential effects on thin-filament formation and protein-protein interactions.

RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression of AT mRNA from the transfected cells. Functional studies (AT activity in the presence and in the absence of heparin and heparin-binding studies with the surface plasmon resonance method) were carried out.

In the present study, we have studied three new Rs1 mutant mouse models: (1) a knockout with inserted lacZ reporter gene; (2) a C59S point mutant substitution and (3) an R141C point mutant substitution. Mice were studied from postnatal day (P15) to 28 weeks by spectral domain optical coherence tomography and ERG. Retinas of P21-22 mice were examined using biochemistry, single cell electrophysiology of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and by immunohistochemistry. Each model developed intraretinal schisis and reductions in the ERG that were greater for the b-wave than the a-wave. The phenotype of the C59S mutant appeared less severe than the other mutants by ERG at adult ages. RGC electrophysiology demonstrated elevated activity in the absence of a visual stimulus and reduced signal-to-noise ratios in response to light stimuli. Immunohistochemical analysis documented early abnormalities in all cells of the outer retina.

18690710,"RS1, also known as retinoschisin, is an extracellular discoidin domain-containing protein that has been implicated in maintaining the cellular organization and synaptic structure of the vertebrate retina. Mutations in the gene encoding RS1 are responsible for X-linked retinoschisis, a retinal degenerative disease characterized by the splitting of the retinal cell layers and visual impairment. To better understand the role of RS1 in retinal cell biology and X-linked retinoschisis, we have studied the interaction of wild-type and mutant RS1 with various carbohydrates coupled to agarose supports. RS1 bound efficiently to galactose-agarose and to a lesser extent lactose-agarose, but not agarose, N-acetylgalactosamine-agarose, N-acetylglucosamine-agarose, mannose-agarose, or heparin-agarose. RS1 cysteine mutants (C59S/C223S and C59S/C223S/C40S) which prevent disulfide-linked octamer formation exhibited little if any binding to galactose-agarose. The disease-causing R141H mutant bound galactose-agarose at levels similar to that of wild-type RS1, whereas the R141S mutant resulted in a marked reduction in the level of galactose-agarose binding. RS1 bound to galactose-agarose could be effectively displaced by incubation with isopropyl beta- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). This property was used as a basis to develop an efficient purification procedure. Anion exchange and galactose affinity chromatography was used to purify RS1 from the culture media of stably transformed Sf21 insect cells that express and secrete RS1.

Expression analysis in COS-7 cells demonstrates that these mutations affect RS1 biosynthesis and result in an RS1 null phenotype by several different mechanisms. By comparison, discoidin-domain mutations generally lead to nonfunctional conformational variants that remain trapped inside the cell. XLRS disease has a broad heterogeneity in general, but subjects with the RS1 null-protein signal-sequence mutations are on the more severe end of the clinical phenotype.

Determining the molecular etiology is essential for patients with monogenic diabetes to benefit from the most appropriate treatment. The increasing number of variants of unknown significance (VUS) is a major issue in genetic diagnosis, and assessing the impact of variants on RNA splicing is challenging, particularly for genes expressed in tissues not easily accessible as in monogenic diabetes. The in vitro functional splicing assay based on a minigene construct is an appropriate approach. Here, we performed in silico analysis using SpliceAI and SPiP and prioritized 36 spliceogenic variants in GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A. Predictions were secondarily compared with Pangolin and AbSplice-DNA bioinformatics tools which include tissue-specific annotations. We assessed the effect of selected variants on RNA splicing using minigene assays. These assays validated splicing defects for 33 out of 36 spliceogenic variants consisting of exon skipping (15%), exonic deletions (18%), intronic retentions (24%), and complex splicing patterns (42%). This provided additional evidence to reclassify 23 out of 31 (74%) VUS including missense, synonymous, and intronic noncanonical splice site variants as likely pathogenic variants. Comparison of in silico analysis with minigene results showed the robustness of bioinformatics tools to prioritize spliceogenic variants, but revealed inconsistencies in the location of cryptic splice sites underlying the importance of confirming predicted splicing alterations with functional splicing assays.

In this report, we establish unequivocal correlations between patient clinical phenotypes and in vitro functional assays of uncharacterized AIPL1 variants. We confirm that missense and nonsense variants in the FKBP-like and tetratricopeptide repeat domains of AIPL1 lead to the loss of both HSP90 interaction and PDE6 activity, confirming these variants cause LCA. In contrast, we report the association of p.G122R with milder forms of retinal degeneration, and show that while p.G122R had no effect on HSP90 binding, the modulation of PDE6 cGMP levels was impaired. The clinical history of these patients together with our functional assays suggest that the p.G122R variant is a rare hypomorphic allele with a later disease onset, amenable to therapeutic intervention. Finally, we report the primate-specific proline-rich domain to be dispensable for both HSP90 interaction and PDE6 activity.

AIPL1 functions as a photoreceptor-specific co-chaperone that interacts with the molecular chaperone HSP90 to facilitate the stable assembly of the retinal cyclic GMP (cGMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE6) holoenzyme. In this study, we characterized the functional deficits of AIPL1 variations, some of which induce aberrant pre-mRNA AIPL1 splicing leading to the production of alternative AIPL1 isoforms. We investigated the ability of the AIPL1 variants to mediate an interaction with HSP90 and modulate the rod cGMP PDE6 stability and activity. Our data revealed that both the FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-like domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of AIPL1 are required for interaction with HSP90. We further demonstrate that AIPL1 significantly modulates the catalytic activity of heterologously expressed rod PDE6. Although the N-terminal FKBP-like domain of AIPL1 binds the farnesylated PDE6α subunit through direct interaction with the farnesyl moiety, mutations compromising the integrity of the C-terminal TPR domain of AIPL1 also failed to modulate PDE6 activity efficiently. These AIPL1 variants moreover failed to promote the HSP90-dependent stabilization of the PDE6α subunit in the cytosol. In summary, we have successfully validated the disease-causing status of the AIPL1 variations in vitro.

Progress in research on PDE6 and AIPL1 has been severely hampered by failure to express functional PDE6 in a heterologous expression system. Here, we demonstrated that AIPL1 is an obligate chaperone of PDE6 and that it enables low yield functional folding of cone PDE6C in cultured cells. We further show that the AIPL1-mediated production of folded PDE6C is markedly elevated in the presence of the inhibitory Pγ-subunit of PDE6. As illustrated in this study, a simple and sensitive system in which AIPL1 and Pγ are co-expressed with PDE6 represents an effective tool for probing structure-function relationships of AIPL1 and reliably establishing the pathogenicity of its variants.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,0,
18538294,"A significant share of patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency benefits from pharmacological doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), the natural PAH cofactor. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is hypothesized to be a conformational disease, with loss of function due to protein destabilization, and the restoration of enzyme function that is observed in BH(4) treatment might be transmitted by correction of protein misfolding. To elucidate the molecular basis of functional impairment in PAH deficiency, we investigated the impact of ten PAH gene mutations identified in patients with BH(4)-responsiveness on enzyme kinetics, stability, and conformation of the protein (F55L, I65S, H170Q, P275L, A300S, S310Y, P314S, R408W, Y414C, Y417H). Residual enzyme activity was generally high, but allostery was disturbed in almost all cases and pointed to altered protein conformation. This was confirmed by reduced proteolytic stability, impaired tetramer assembly or aggregation, increased hydrophobicity, and accelerated thermal unfolding--with particular impact on the regulatory domain--observed in most variants. Three-dimensional modeling revealed the involvement of functionally relevant amino acid networks that may communicate misfolding throughout the protein. Our results substantiate the view that PAH deficiency is a protein-misfolding disease in which global conformational changes hinder molecular motions essential for physiological enzyme function. Thus, PKU has evolved from a model of a genetic disease that leads to severe neurological impairment to a model of a treatable protein-folding disease with loss of function.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
38651838,"SCN2A-related disorders secondary to altered function in the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 are rare, with clinically heterogeneous expressions that include epilepsy, autism and multiple severe to profound impairments and other conditions. To advance understanding of the clinical phenotypes and their relationship to channel function, 81 patients (36 female, 44%, median age 5.4 years) with 69 unique SCN2A variants were systematically phenotyped and their Nav1.2 channel function systematically assessed. Participants were recruited through the FamileSCN2A Foundation. Primary phenotype (epilepsy of neonatal onset, n = 27; infant onset, n = 18; and later onset n = 24; and autism without seizures, n = 12) was strongly correlated with a non-seizure severity index (P = 0.002), which was based on presence of severe impairments in gross motor, fine motor, communication abilities, gastrostomy tube dependence and diagnosis of cortical visual impairment and scoliosis. Non-seizure severity was greatest in the neonatal-onset group and least in the autism group (P = 0.002). Children with the lowest severity indices were still severely impaired, as reflected by an average Vineland Adaptive Behavior composite score of 49.5 (>3 standard deviations below the norm-referenced mean of the test). Epileptic spasms were significantly more common in infant-onset (67%) than in neonatal (22%) or later-onset (29%) epilepsy (P = 0.007). Primary phenotype was also strongly correlated with variant function (P < 0.0001); gain-of-function and mixed function variants predominated in neonatal-onset epilepsy, shifting to moderate loss of function in infant-onset epilepsy and to severe and complete loss of function in later-onset epilepsy and autism groups. Exploratory cluster analysis identified five groups, representing: (i) primarily later-onset epilepsy with moderate loss-of-function variants and low severity indices; (ii) mostly infant-onset epilepsy with moderate loss-of-function variants but higher severity indices; and (iii) late-onset and autism only, with the lowest severity indices (mostly zero) and severe/complete loss-of-function variants. Two exclusively neonatal clusters were distinguished from each other largely on non-seizure severity scores and secondarily on variant function. The relationship between primary phenotype and variant function emphasizes the role of developmental factors in the differential clinical expression of SCN2A variants based on their effects on Nav1.2 channel function. The non-seizure severity of SCN2A disorders depends on a combination of the age at seizure onset (primary phenotype) and variant function. As precision therapies for SCN2A-related disorders advance towards clinical trials, knowledge of the relationship between variant function and clinical disease expression will be valuable for identifying appropriate patients for these trials and in selecting efficient clinical outcomes.",PS3_strong,1,1,,1,
37578743,"Pathogenic variants in voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel genes including SCN2A, encoding NaV1.2, are discovered frequently in neurodevelopmental disorders with or without epilepsy. SCN2A is also a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID). Previous work to determine the functional consequences of SCN2A variants yielded a paradigm in which predominantly gain-of-function variants cause neonatal-onset epilepsy, whereas loss-of-function variants are associated with ASD and ID. However, this framework was derived from a limited number of studies conducted under heterogeneous experimental conditions, whereas most disease-associated SCN2A variants have not been functionally annotated. We determined the functional properties of SCN2A variants using automated patch-clamp recording to demonstrate the validity of this method and to examine whether a binary classification of variant dysfunction is evident in a larger cohort studied under uniform conditions. We studied 28 disease-associated variants and 4 common variants using two alternatively spliced isoforms of NaV1.2 expressed in HEK293T cells. Automated patch-clamp recording provided a valid high throughput method to ascertain detailed functional properties of NaV1.2 variants with concordant findings for variants that were previously studied using manual patch clamp. Many epilepsy-associated variants in our study exhibited complex patterns of gain- and loss-of-functions that are difficult to classify by a simple binary scheme. The higher throughput achievable with automated patch clamp enables study of variants with greater standardization of recording conditions, freedom from operator bias, and enhanced experimental rigor. This approach offers an enhanced ability to discern relationships between channel dysfunction and neurodevelopmental disorders.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
29648639,"Six pathogenic mutations have been reported in human mitochondrial tRNAThr (hmtRNAThr); however, the pathogenic molecular mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we established an activity assay system for human mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (hmThrRS). In the present study, we surveyed the structural and enzymatic effects of pathogenic mutations in hmtRNAThr and then focused on m.15915 G > A (G30A) and m.15923A > G (A38G). The harmful evolutionary gain of non-Watson-Crick base pair A29/C41 caused hmtRNAThr to be highly susceptible to mutations disrupting the G30-C40 base pair in various ways; for example, structural integrity maintenance, modification and aminoacylation of tRNAThr, and editing mischarged tRNAThr. A similar phenomenon was observed for hmtRNATrp with an A29/C41 non-Watson-Crick base pair, but not in bovine mtRNAThr with a natural G29-C41 base pair. The A38G mutation caused a severe reduction in Thr-acceptance and editing of hmThrRS. Importantly, A38 is a nucleotide determinant for the t6A modification at A37, which is essential for the coding properties of hmtRNAThr. In summary, our results revealed the crucial role of the G30-C40 base pair in maintaining the proper structure and function of hmtRNAThr because of A29/C41 non-Watson-Crick base pair and explained the molecular outcome of pathogenic G30A and A38G mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
17083647,"BACKGROUND: Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a severe inherited bleeding disorder that is caused by a defect in glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V complex, the platelet membrane receptor for von Willebrand factor.
PATIENTS: The diagnosis of BSS was made in two members of a Bukharian Jewish family who had life-long thrombocytopenia associated with mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry and Western blot analyses showed only trace amounts of GPIb and GPIX on the patients' platelets. Sequence analysis of the GPIbalpha gene revealed a homozygous T > G transversion at nucleotide 709 predicting Trp207Gly substitution in the mature protein. Introduction of the mutation into a mammalian expression construct abolished the surface expression of GPIbalpha in transfected baby hamster kidney cells. The crystal structure of the N-terminus of GPIbalpha (PDB: 1SQ0) indicates that Trp207 is completely buried and located in a disulfide loop structure that interacts with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain.
CONCLUSION: A novel mutation, Trp207Gly, causes BSS and predicts disruption of the interaction between a disulfide loop and the LRR domain that is essential for the integrity of GPIbalpha structure.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
26133172,"Defects in filamin A (FLNA) gene could lead to low platelet counts and decreased surface expression of glycoprotein (GP) Ibα. Here, we report and investigate the FLNA genomic alteration of a case with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), a rare hereditary bleeding disorder caused by quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in the GP Ib-IX-V receptor. DNA sequencing analysis reveals the presence of a GP Ibα c.987G > A mutation and a FLNA c.1582 G > A mutation in this patient. Transient transfection studies show that GP Ibα c.987G > A mutation abolishes the surface expression of GP Ibα on the transfected CHO cells. On the other hand, abnormal responses to collagen, including the platelet aggregation, secretion, and GP VI signaling pathways, are associated with FLNA c.1582G > A mutation. Our findings confirm a central role for FLNA in platelet-adhesive functions. The interaction between FLNA and GP Ibα in platelets deserves to be investigated.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
20161772,"Inherited cardiomyopathy (CM) represents a diverse group of cardiac muscle diseases that present with a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from benign to highly malignant. Contributing to this genetic complexity and clinical heterogeneity is the emergence of a cohort of patients that are double or compound heterozygotes who have inherited two different CM mutant alleles in the same or different sarcomeric gene. These patients typically have early disease onset with worse clinical outcomes. Little experimental attention has been directed towards elucidating the physiologic basis of double CM mutations at the cellular-molecular level. Here, dual gene transfer to isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes was used to determine the primary effects of co-expressing two different CM-linked mutant proteins on intact cardiac myocyte contractile physiology. Dual expression of two CM mutants, that alone moderately increase myofilament activation, tropomyosin mutant A63V and cardiac troponin mutant R146G, were shown to additively slow myocyte relaxation beyond either mutant studied in isolation. These results were qualitatively similar to a combination of moderate and strong activating CM mutant alleles alphaTmA63V and cTnI R193H, which approached a functional threshold. Interestingly, a combination of a CM myofilament deactivating mutant, troponin C G159D, together with an activating mutant, cTnIR193H, produced a hybrid phenotype that blunted the strong activating phenotype of cTnIR193H alone. This is evidence of neutralizing effects of activating/deactivating mutant alleles in combination. Taken together, this combinatorial mutant allele functional analysis lends molecular insight into disease severity and forms the foundation for a predictive model to deconstruct the myriad of possible CM double mutations in presenting patients.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
18408133,"Transgenic mice were generated to express a restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) R192H mutation in the heart (cTnI(193His) mice). The objective of this study was to assess cardiac function during the development of diastolic dysfunction and to gain insight into the pathophysiological impact of the RCM cTnI mutation. Cardiac function and pathophysiological changes were monitored in cTnI193His mice and wild-type littermates for a period of 12 mo. It progressed gradually from abnormal relaxation to diastolic dysfunction characterized with high-resolution echocardiography by a reversed E-to-A ratio, increased deceleration time, and prolonged isovolumetric relaxation time. At the age of 12 mo, cardiac output in cTnI(193His) mice was significantly declined, and some transgenic mice showed congestive heart failure. The negative impact of cTnI193His on ventricular contraction and relaxation was further demonstrated in isolated mouse working heart preparations. The main morphological change in cTnI193His myocytes was shortened cell length. Dobutamine stimulation increased heart rate in cTnI193His mice but did not improve CO. The cTnI193His mice had a phenotype similar to that in human RCM patients carrying the cTnI mutation characterized morphologically by enlarged atria and restricted ventricles and functionally by diastolic dysfunction and diastolic heart failure. The results demonstrate a critical role of the COOH-terminal domain of cTnI in the diastolic function of cardiac muscle.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
22675533,"The contractile response of the heart can be altered by disease-related protein modifications to numerous contractile proteins. By utilizing an IAANS labeled fluorescent troponin C, [Formula: see text], we examined the effects of ten disease-related troponin modifications on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the troponin complex and the reconstituted thin filament. The selected modifications are associated with a broad range of cardiac diseases: three subtypes of familial cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive) and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consistent with previous studies, the majority of the protein modifications had no effect on the Ca(2+) binding properties of the isolated troponin complex. However, when incorporated into the thin filament, dilated cardiomyopathy mutations desensitized (up to 3.3-fold), while hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy mutations, and ischemia-induced truncation of troponin I, sensitized the thin filament to Ca(2+) (up to 6.3-fold). Kinetically, the dilated cardiomyopathy mutations increased the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from the thin filament (up to 2.5-fold), while the hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy mutations, and the ischemia-induced truncation of troponin I decreased the rate (up to 2-fold). The protein modifications also increased (up to 5.4-fold) or decreased (up to 2.5-fold) the apparent rate of Ca(2+) association to the thin filament. Thus, the disease-related protein modifications alter Ca(2+) binding by influencing both the association and dissociation rates of thin filament Ca(2+) exchange. These alterations in Ca(2+) exchange kinetics influenced the response of the thin filament to artificial Ca(2+) transients generated in a stopped-flow apparatus. Troponin C may act as a hub, sensing physiological and pathological stimuli to modulate the Ca(2+)-binding properties of the thin filament and influence the contractile performance of the heart.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
19289050,"We examined four cardiomyopathy-causing mutations of troponin I that appear to disturb function by altering the distribution of thin filament states. The R193H (mouse) troponin I mutant had greater than normal actin-activated myosin-S1 ATPase activity in both the presence and absence of calcium. The rate of ATPase activity was the same as that of the wild-type at near-saturating concentrations of the activator, N-ethylmaleimide-S1. This mutant appeared to function by stabilizing the active state of thin filaments. Mutations D191H, R146G, and R146W had lower ATPase activities in the presence of calcium, but higher activities in the absence of calcium. These effects were most pronounced with mutations at position 146. For all three mutants the rates were similar to those of the wild-type at near-saturating concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide-S1. These results, combined with previous results, show that any alteration in the normal distribution of actomyosin states is capable of producing cardiomyopathy. The results of the D191H, R146G, and R146W mutations are most readily explained if the intermediate state of regulated actin has a unique function. The intermediate state appears to have an ability to accelerate the rate of ATP hydrolysis by myosin that exceeds that of the inactive state.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
28239629,"Troponin, a contractile protein of the thin filament of striated muscle, consists of three subunits: troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) plays a critical role in regulation of cardiac function. The physiological effect of cTnI, as an inhibitory subunit of troponin complex, is to prevent the interaction between myosin heavy chain heads and actins, i.e. the cross-bridge formation, and to ensure a proper relaxation of cardiac myofilaments. In pathological conditions, the deficiency of cTnI or mutations in cTnI especially in the C-terminus of cTnI is associated with diastolic dysfunction caused by myofibril hypersensitivity to Ca2+. Our laboratory has generated cTnI knockout mouse model to investigate the cellular and molecular function of cTnI and created cTnI mutant disease mouse models to explore the pathophysiology caused by cTnI mutations in the heart. Here, we present our recent studies on physiological function of cTnI in the heart and the pathological consequences caused by the cTnI mutations in the diseased heart using the transgenic mouse models. The mechanisms underlying diastolic dysfunction and heart failure caused by cTnI mutations are explored in cell-based assays and in transgenic animal models. These studies provide us with useful information in searching for therapeutic strategies and target-oriented medication for the treatment of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
15961398,"Human cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) is the first sarcomeric protein for which mutations have been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy. To determine whether five mutations in cTnI (L144Q, R145W, A171T, K178E, and R192H) associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy were distinguishable from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in cTnI, actomyosin ATPase activity and skinned fiber studies were carried out. All five mutations investigated showed an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with wild-type cTnI. The two mutations with the worst clinical phenotype (K178E and R192H) both showed large increases in Ca2+ sensitivity (deltapCa50 = 0.47 and 0.36, respectively). Although at least one of these mutations is not in the known inhibitory regions of cTnI, all of the mutations investigated caused a decrease in the ability of cTnI to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant cTnI showed that cTnI mutants could be classified into three different groups: dominant (L144Q, A171T and R192H), equivalent (K178E), or weaker (R145W) than wild-type cTnI in actomyosin ATPase assays in the absence of Ca2+. Although most of the mutants were able to activate actomyosin ATPase similarly to wild-type cTnI, L144Q had significantly lower maximal ATPase activities than any of the other mutants or wild-type cTnI. Three mutants (L144Q, R145W, and K178E) were unable to fully relax contraction in the absence of Ca2+. The inability of the five cTnI mutations investigated to fully inhibit ATPase activity/force development and the generally larger increases in Ca2+ sensitivity than observed for most hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations would likely lead to severe diastolic dysfunction and may be the major physiological factors responsible for causing the restrictive cardiomyopathy phenotype in some of the genetically affected individuals.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
16531415,"To understand the molecular mechanisms whereby cardiomyopathy-related cardiac troponin I (cTnI) mutations affect myofilament activity, we have investigated the Ca2+ binding properties of various assemblies of the regulatory components that contain one of the cardiomyopahty-related mutant cTnI. Acto-S1 ATPase activities in reconstituted systems were also determined. We investigated R145G and R145W mutations from the inhibitory region and D190H and R192H mutations from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site. Each of the four mutations sensitized the acto-S1 ATPase to Ca2+. Whereas the mutations from the inhibitory region increased the basal level of ATPase activity, those from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site did not. The effects on the Ca2+ binding properties of the troponin ternary complex and the troponin-tropomyosin complex with one of four mutations were either desensitization or no effect compared with those with wild-type cTnI. All of the mutations, however, affected the Ca2+ sensitivities of the reconstituted thin filaments in the same direction as the acto-S1 ATPase activity. Also the thin filaments with one of the mutant cTnIs bound Ca2+ with less cooperativity compared with those with wild-type cTnI. These data indicate that the mutations found in the inhibitory region and those from the second actin-tropomyosin site shift the equilibrium of the states of the thin filaments differently. Moreover, the increased Ca2+ bound to myofilaments containing the mutant cTnIs may be an important factor in triggered arrhythmias associated with the cardiomyopathy.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

To understand how these mutations produce dysfunction, five TnTs were produced and purified containing FHC mutations found in several regions of TnT. Functional defects were diverse. Mutations F110I, E244D, and COOH-terminal truncation weakened the affinity of troponin for the thin filament. Mutation DeltaE160 resulted in thin filaments with increased calcium affinity at the regulatory site of troponin C. Mutations R92Q and F110I resulted in impaired troponin solubility, suggesting abnormal protein folding. Depending upon the mutation, the in vitro unloaded actin-myosin sliding speed showed small increases, showed small decreases, or was unchanged. COOH-terminal truncation mutation resulted in a decreased thin filament-myosin subfragment 1 MgATPase rate. The results indicate that the mutations cause diverse immediate effects, despite similarities in disease manifestations. Separable but repeatedly observed abnormalities resulting from FHC TnT mutations include increased unloaded sliding speed, increased or decreased Ca(2+) affinity, impairment of folding or sarcomeric integrity, and decreased force. Enhancement as well as impairment of contractile protein function is observed, suggesting that TnT, including the troponin tail region, modulates the regulation of cardiac contraction.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
22579624,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is one of the most common genetic causes of heart disease. Approximately 15% of FHC-related mutations are found in cTnT [cardiac troponin (cTn) T]. Most of the cTnT FHC-related mutations are in or flanking the N-tail TNT1 domain that directly interacts with overlapping tropomyosin (Tm). We investigate two sets of cTnT mutations at opposite ends of TNT1, mutations in residue 92 in the Tm-Tm overlap region of TNT1 and mutations in residues 160 and 163 in the C-terminal portion of TNT1 adjacent to the cTnT H1-H2 linker. Though all the mutations are located within TNT1, they have widely different phenotypes clinically and biophysically. Using a complete atomistic model of the cTn-Tm complex, we identify mechanisms by which the effects of TNT1 mutations propagate to the cTn core and site II of cTnC, where calcium binding and dissociation occurs. We find that mutations in TNT1 alter the flexibility of TNT1, which is inversely proportional to the cooperativity of calcium activation of the thin filament. Further, we identify a pathway of propagation of structural and dynamic changes from TNT1 to site II of cTnC, including TNT1, cTnT linker, I-T arm, regulatory domain of cTnI, the D-E linker of cTnC, and site II cTnC. Mutationally induced changes at site II of cTnC alter calcium coordination that corresponds to biophysical measurements of calcium sensitivity. Finally, we compare this pathway of mutational propagation with that of the calcium activation of the thin filament and find that they are identical but opposite in direction.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,0,

A highly charged region at the C-terminal end of TNT1 unwinds to create a flexible ""hinge"". While this region has not been structurally resolved, it likely acts as an extended linker between the two cTnT functional domains. Mutations in this region cause phenotypically diverse and often severe forms of HCM. Mechanistic insight, however, has been limited by the lack of structural information. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated the effects of cTnT 160-163 mutations using regulated in vitro motility (R-IVM) assays and transgenic mouse models. R-IVM revealed that cTnT mutations Δ160E, E163R and E163K disrupted weak electrostatic actomyosin binding. Reducing the ionic strength or decreasing Brownian motion rescued function. This is the first observation of HCM-linked mutations in cTnT disrupting weak interactions between the thin filament and myosin. To evaluate the in vivo effects of altering weak actomyosin binding we generated transgenic mice expressing Δ160E and E163R mutant cTnT and observed severe cardiac remodeling and profound myofilament disarray.

We used the quantitative in vitro motility assay to study Ca(2+)-regulation of unloaded movement and its modulation by troponin I phosphorylation. Troponin from a patient with the K280N TnT mutation showed no difference in Ca(2+)-sensitivity when compared with donor heart troponin and the Ca(2+)-sensitivity was also independent of the troponin I phosphorylation level (uncoupled). The recombinant K280N TnT mutation increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity 1.7-fold and was also uncoupled. The R92Q TnT mutation in troponin from transgenic mouse increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity and was also completely uncoupled. Five TnT mutations (Δ14, Δ28 + 7, ΔE160, S179F and K273E) studied in recombinant troponin increased Ca(2+)-sensitivity and were all fully uncoupled. Thus, for HCM-causing mutations in TnT, Ca(2+)-sensitisation together with uncoupling in vitro is the usual response and both factors may contribute to the HCM phenotype. We also found that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can restore coupling to all uncoupled HCM-causing TnT mutations. In fact the combination of Ca(2+)-desensitisation and re-coupling due to EGCG completely reverses both the abnormalities found in troponin with a TnT HCM mutation suggesting it may have therapeutic potential.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

The actin mutation caused a higher Ca(2+) sensitivity in reconstituted thin filaments measured by in vitro motility assay (2.3-fold for mice and 1.3-fold for humans) and in skinned papillary muscle. The mutation also abolished the change in Ca(2+) sensitivity normally linked to troponin I phosphorylation. MyBP-C and troponin I phosphorylation levels were the same as controls in transgenic mice and human carrier heart samples. ACTC E99K mice exhibited a high death rate between 28 and 45 days (48% females and 22% males). At 21 weeks, the hearts of the male survivors had enlarged atria, increased interstitial fibrosis, and sarcomere disarray. MRI showed hypertrophy, predominantly at the apex of the heart. End-diastolic volume and end-diastolic pressure were increased, and relaxation rates were reduced compared with nontransgenic littermates. End-systolic pressures and volumes were unaltered. ECG abnormalities were present, and the contractile response to β-adrenergic stimulation was much reduced. Older mice (29-week-old females and 38-week-old males) developed dilated cardiomyopathy with increased end-systolic volume and continuing increased end-diastolic pressure and slower contraction and relaxation rates. ECG showed atrial flutter and frequent atrial ectopic beats at rest in some ACTC E99K mice. We propose that the ACTC E99K mutation causes higher myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity that is responsible for the sudden cardiac death, apical hypertrophy, and subsequent development of heart failure in humans and mice.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Changes in the SRX are likely to modulate cardiac contractility. We previously demonstrated that the SRX is significantly reduced in mouse cardiomyocytes lacking cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, we report the effect of mutations in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) using samples from human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Left ventricular (LV) samples from 11 HCM patients were obtained following myectomy surgery to relieve LV outflow tract obstruction. HCM samples were genotyped as either MYBPC3 mutation positive (MYBPC3mut) or negative (HCMsmn) and were compared to eight non-failing donor hearts. Compared to donors, only MYBPC3mut samples display a significantly diminished SRX, characterised by a decrease in both the number of myosin heads in the SRX and the lifetime of ATP turnover. These changes were not observed in HCMsmn samples. There was a positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the expression of cMyBP-C and the proportion of myosin heads in the SRX state, suggesting cMyBP-C modulates and maintains the SRX. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain in MYBPC3mut samples was significantly decreased compared to the other groups, suggesting a potential mechanism to compensate for the diminished SRX. We conclude that by altering both contractility and sarcomeric energy requirements, a reduced SRX may be an important disease mechanism in patients with MYBPC3 mutations.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
28371863,"AIMS: The E143K (Glu → Lys) mutation in the myosin essential light chain has been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in humans, but the mechanisms that underlie the development of defective cardiac function are unknown. Using transgenic E143K-RCM mice, we sought to determine the molecular and cellular triggers of E143K-induced heart remodelling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The E143K-induced abnormalities in cardiac function and morphology observed by echocardiography and invasive haemodynamics were paralleled by augmented active and passive tension measured in skinned papillary muscle fibres compared with wild-type (WT)-generated force. In vitro, E143K-myosin had increased duty ratio and binding affinity to actin compared with WT-myosin, increased actin-activated ATPase activity and slower rates of ATP-dependent dissociation of the acto-myosin complex, indicating an E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility. E143K was also observed to reduce the level of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation while that of troponin-I remained unchanged. Small-angle X-ray diffraction data showed a decrease in the filament lattice spacing (d1,0) with no changes in the equatorial reflections intensity ratios (I1,1/I1,0) in E143K vs. WT skinned papillary muscles. The hearts of mutant-mice demonstrated ultrastructural defects and fibrosis that progressively worsened in senescent animals and these changes were hypothesized to contribute to diastolic disturbance and to mild systolic dysfunction. Gene expression profiles of E143K-hearts supported the histopathology results and showed an upregulation of stress-response and collagen genes. Finally, proteomic analysis evidenced RCM-dependent metabolic adaptations and higher energy demands in E143K vs. WT hearts.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility, the hearts of RCM mice model exhibited cardiac dysfunction, stiff ventricles and physiological, morphologic, and metabolic remodelling consistent with the development of RCM. Future efforts should be directed toward normalization of myosin motor function and the use of myosin-specific therapeutics to avert the hypercontractile state of E143K-myosin and prevent pathological cardiac remodelling.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,

Transgenic mice express human ventricular essential light chain (ELC) in wild- type (WT), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutant forms, A57G or E143K, in a background of mouse α-cardiac myosin heavy chain. Ensemble motility and single myosin mechanical characteristics are consistent with an A57G that impairs ELC N-terminus actin binding and an E143K that impairs lever-arm stability, while both species down-shift average step-size with increasing load. Cardiac myosin in vivo down-shifts velocity/force ratio with increasing load by changed unitary step-size selections. Here, the loaded in vitro single myosin assay indicates quantitative complementarity with the in vivo mechanism. Both have two embedded regulatory transitions, one inhibiting ADP release and a second novel mechanism inhibiting actin detachment via strain on the actin-bound ELC N-terminus. Competing regulators filter unitary step-size selection to control force-velocity modulation without myosin integration into muscle. Cardiac myosin is muscle in a molecule.",PS3_supporting,1,1,,1,
8958207,"Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene are believed to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by acting as dominant negative alleles. In contrast, a truncated cardiac troponin T (TnT) that causes HCM implies that altered stoichiometry of contractile proteins may also cause cardiac hypertrophy. Wild-type and HCM-mutant (truncated) TnT were studied in a novel quail myotube expression system. Unexpectedly, antibody staining demonstrated incorporation of both forms of human cardiac TnT into the sarcomeres of quail myotubes. Functional studies of wild type and mutant transfected myotubes of normal appearance revealed that calcium-activated force of contraction was normal upon incorporation of wild type TnT, but greatly diminished for the mutant TnT. These findings indicate that HCM-causing mutations in TnT and beta-myosin heavy chain share abnormalities in common, acting as dominant negative alleles that impair contractile performance. This diminished force output is the likely stimulus for hypertrophy in the human heart.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
9637714,"Mutations in multiple cardiac sarcomeric proteins including myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) cause a dominant genetic heart disease, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Patients with mutations in these two genes have quite distinct clinical characteristics. Those with MyHC mutations demonstrate more significant and uniform cardiac hypertrophy and a variable frequency of sudden death. Patients with cTnT mutations generally exhibit mild or no hypertrophy, but a high frequency of sudden death at an early age. To understand the basis for these distinctions and to study the pathogenesis of the disease, we have created transgenic mice expressing a truncated mouse cTnT allele analogous to one found in FHC patients. Mice expressing truncated cTnT at low (< 5%) levels develop cardiomyopathy and their hearts are significantly smaller (18-27%) than wild type. These animals also exhibit significant diastolic dysfunction and milder systolic dysfunction. Animals that express higher levels of transgene protein die within 24 h of birth. Transgenic mouse hearts demonstrate myocellular disarray and have a reduced number of cardiac myocytes that are smaller in size. These studies suggest that multiple cellular mechanisms result in the human disease, which is generally characterized by mild hypertrophy, but, also, frequent sudden death.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
10617660,"To study the effect of troponin (Tn) T mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) on cardiac muscle contraction, wild-type, and the following recombinant human cardiac TnT mutants were cloned and expressed: I79N, R92Q, F110I, E163K, R278C, and intron 16(G(1) --> A) (In16). These TnT FHC mutants were reconstituted into skinned cardiac muscle preparations and characterized for their effect on maximal steady state force activation, inhibition, and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development. Troponin complexes containing these mutants were tested for their ability to regulate actin-tropomyosin(Tm)-activated myosin-ATPase activity. TnT(R278C) and TnT(F110I) reconstituted preparations demonstrated dramatically increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development, while those with TnT(R92Q) and TnT(I79N) showed a moderate increase. The deletion mutant, TnT(In16), significantly decreased both the activation and the inhibition of force, and substantially decreased the activation and the inhibition of actin-Tm-activated myosin-ATPase activity. ATPase activation was also impaired by TnT(F110I), while its inhibition was reduced by TnT(R278C). The TnT(E163K) mutation had the smallest effect on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force; however, it produced an elevated activation of the ATPase activity in reconstituted thin filaments. These observed changes in the Ca(2+) regulation of force development caused by these mutations would likely cause altered contractility and contribute to the development of FHC.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,
15568820,"The complex of tropomyosin and troponin binds to actin and inhibits activation of myosin ATPase activity and force production of striated muscles at low free Ca(2+) concentrations. Ca(2+) stimulates ATP activity, and at subsaturating actin concentrations, the binding of NEM-modified S1 to actin-tropomyosin-troponin increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis even further. We show here that the Delta14 mutation of troponin T, associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, results in an increase in ATPase rate like that seen with wild-type troponin in the presence of NEM-S1. The enhanced ATPase activity was not due to a decreased incorporation of mutant troponin T with troponin I and troponin C to form an active troponin complex. The activating effect was more prominent with a hybrid troponin (skeletal TnI, TnC, and cardiac TnT) than with all cardiac troponin. Thus it appears that changes in the troponin-troponin contacts that result from mutations or from forming hybrids stabilize a more active state of regulated actin. An analysis of the effect of the Delta14 mutation on the equilibrium binding of S1-ADP to actin was consistent with stabilization of an active state of actin. This change in activation may be important in the development of cardiac disease.",PS3_moderate,1,1,,1,

Mutations in ABCA4 cause Stargardt macular degeneration (STGD1), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a loss of central vision and the accumulation of bisretinoid compounds. The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular properties of ABCA4 variants harboring disease-causing missense mutations in the transmembrane domains. Thirty-eight variants expressed in culture cells were analyzed for expression, ATPase activities, and substrate binding. On the basis of these properties, the variants were divided into three classes: Class 1 (severe variants) exhibited significantly reduced ABCA4 expression and basal ATPase activity that was not stimulated by its substrate N-Ret-PE; Class 2 (moderate variants) showed a partial reduction in expression and basal ATPase activity that was modestly stimulated by N-Ret-PE; and Class 3 (mild variants) displayed expression and functional properties comparable to normal ABCA4. The p.R653C variant displayed normal expression and basal ATPase activity, but lacked substrate binding and ATPase activation, suggesting that arginine 653 contributes to N-Ret-PE binding.

37011710,"The von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric plasma glycoprotein essential for hemostasis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The majority of VWF is synthesized by endothelial cells (ECs) and stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). Among the range of proteins shown to co-localize to WPB is angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), a ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. We have previously shown that VWF itself regulates angiogenesis, raising the hypothesis that some of the angiogenic activity of VWF may be mediated by its interaction with Angpt-2.
Static-binding assays were used to probe the interaction between Angpt-2 and VWF. Binding in media from cultured human umbilical vein ECs s and in plasma was determined by immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the presence of Angpt-2 on VWF strings, and flow assays were used to investigate the effect on VWF function.
Static-binding assays revealed that Angpt-2 bound to VWF with high affinity (KD,app∼3 nM) in a pH and calcium-dependent manner. The interaction was localized to the VWF A1 domain. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the complex persisted following stimulated secretion from ECs and was present in plasma. Angpt-2 was also visible on VWF strings on stimulated ECs. The VWF-Angpt-2 complex did not inhibit the binding of Angpt-2 to Tie-2 and did not significantly interfere with VWF-platelet capture.
Together, these data demonstrate a direct binding interaction between Angpt-2 and VWF that persists after secretion. VWF may act to localize Angpt-2; further work is required to establish the functional consequences of this interaction.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

We fused Gaussia luciferase (eGLuc2) to MYOC variants and expressed the constructs in HEK-293T and NTM-5 cells. Secreted and intracellular levels of MYOC eGLuc2 variants were evaluated by Western blotting and compared to untagged and FLAG-tagged MYOC constructs. Secreted and soluble intracellular MYOC eGLuc2 were measured by a GLuc assay. The secretion of nine additional MYOC mutants was assayed in conditioned media from transfected cells to test the applicability of the assay for monitoring other MYOC variants.
Myocilin eGLuc2 behaved similarly to untagged and FLAG-tagged MYOC with respect to secretion, soluble intracellular levels, and in response to drug treatment. The GLuc assay could sensitively detect Y437H MYOC secretion 30 minutes after media change. Gaussia luciferase fused variants followed anticipated trends; nonpathogenic variants (D208E, G244V) were secreted at wild-type (WT) levels, whereas predicted disease-causing variants (C245Y, G246R, E300K, Y437H, I477N) demonstrated substantial secretion defects. Secretion defects caused by the C245Y, G246R, and Y437H mutations were partially rescued by permissive growth temperature. Interestingly, however, this increase in secretion was independent of newly synthesized protein.
Fusion of eGLuc2 to MYOC does not significantly change the behavior of MYOC. This newly developed MYOC reporter system can be used to study engineered MYOC variants and potentially to identify modulators of MYOC secretion and function.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

We report the first characterization of the gating properties of M34T, which had previously been reported to be nonfunctional. Although homotypic mutant channels did not produce detectable currents, heterotypic pairings with wtCx26 confirmed that M34T formed intercellular channels, although the gating properties were altered. Cx26M34T displayed an inverted response to transjunctional voltage (Vj), mediating currents that activate in a time- and Vj-dependent manner. These characteristics suggest that the channel population is only partially open at rest, consistent with previous reports that dye transfer in M34T-expressing cells is reduced or abolished (e.g., Thonnissen et al., Human Genet. 111, 190-197). To investigate the controversial recessive/dominant behavior of this mutant, we coexpressed M34T with wtCx26 RNA at equimolar levels, mimicking the situation in heterozygotic individuals. Under these conditions, M34T did not significantly reduce Cx26/Cx26 coupling, or alter the electrophysiological properties of the wt channels, consistent with the recessive nature of the allele. Overexpression of the mutant did have some inhibitory effects on conductance, possibly explaining some of the previous reports in exogenous expression systems and some patients. Consistent with its electrophysiological behavior, we also show that M34T localizes to cell junctions in both transfected HeLa cells and patient-derived tissue.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Measurement of respiratory chain enzymatic activities failed to detect a difference between the homoplasmic mutant and homoplasmic wild-type cybrid cell lines. However, a subtle decrease in the steady-state levels of tRNA(Glu) transcripts in some mutant clones.

28814660,"Cross-reactive immunological material-negative (CRIM-negative) infantile Pompe disease (IPD) patients develop an immune response against enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa that nullifies ERT efficacy. Prophylactic immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG successfully prevents development of deleterious rhGAA IgG antibodies; however, safety, likelihood of success, and long-term efficacy of ITI in a larger cohort remain unknown.
Clinical data were analyzed for 19 CRIM-negative IPD patients who received ITI with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG in the ERT-naive setting (ERT+ITI) and compared to a historical cohort of 10 CRIM-negative IPD patients on ERT monotherapy.
ITI was safely tolerated, although infections were reported in 4 patients. Fourteen (74%) ERT+ITI patients were alive, with a median age of 44.2 months at their final assessment. The eldest survivor was 103.9 months old, with 100.2 months of follow-up after initiation of ERT+ITI. Death (n = 5) occurred at a median age of 29.2 months and was unrelated to the administration of ITI. Fifteen patients either did not seroconvert (n = 8) or maintained low titers (n = 7; defined as titers of ≤6,400 throughout the course of ERT) following ERT+ITI. Only one patient developed high and sustained antibody titers (defined as titers of ≥51,200 at or beyond 6 months on ERT). Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) decreased from a median of 248.5 g/m2 at baseline to 76.8 g/m2 at a median time from ERT+ITI initiation to 59 weeks. ERT+ITI significantly improved overall survival (P = 0.001), eliminated/reduced antibodies at values of ≤6,400 at week 52 on ERT (P = 0.0004), and improved LVMI at week 52 on ERT (P = 0.02) when compared with ERT monotherapy.
Evidence from this international cohort of CRIM-negative IPD patients further supports the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of ITI in the prevention of immune responses to ERT.

Abnormalities at different steps of this signaling cascade result in neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes, or the RASopathies, a group of disorders with overlapping yet distinct phenotypes.

Congenital heart disease, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and pulmonic stenosis, are prominent features in these disorders. Significant locus heterogeneity exists for many of the RASopathies. Traditionally, these diseases were thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

This study compares the diagnostic workflow in two centers and gives valuable insights into different next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies. Moreover, we present data from 620 patients sequenced at both centers. Both sequencing centers are part of the German consortium for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (GC-HBOC). All 620 patients included in this study were selected following standard BRCA1/2 testing guidelines. A set of 10 sequenced genes was analyzed per patient. Twelve samples were exchanged and sequenced at both centers. NGS results were highly concordant in 12 exchanged samples (205/206 variants = 99.51 %). One non-pathogenic variant was missed at center B due to a sequencing gap (no technical coverage). The custom enrichment at center B was optimized during this study; for example, the average number of missing bases was reduced by a factor of four (vers. 1: 1939.41, vers. 4: 506.01 bp). There were no sequencing gaps at center A, but four CCDS exons were not included in the enrichment.

The USH2A gene was initially identified as a transcript comprised of 21 exons but subsequently a longer isoform containing 72 exons was identified.
The 51 exons unique to the long isoform of USH2A were screened for mutations among a core set of 108 patients diagnosed with USH2 and 80 patients with non-syndromic RP who were all included in a previously reported screen of the short isoform of USH2A. For several exons, additional patients were screened.
In total, 35 deleterious mutations were identified including 17 nonsense mutations, 9 frameshift mutations, 5 splice-site mutations, and 4 small in-frame deletions or insertions. Twenty-seven mutations were novel. In addition, 65 rare missense changes were identified. A method of classifying the deleterious effect of the missense changes was developed using the summed results of four different mutation assessment algorithms, SIFT, pMUT, PolyPhen, and AGVGD.

The radiologic data of 9 patients who presented between 2007 and 2012 with otovestibular deterioration caused by a mutation in the COCH gene were reviewed.
All 9 subjects were carriers of the same c.151C > T, p.Pro51Ser (P51S) - missense mutation in the COCH gene. In 8 of them similar sclerotic lesions and/or narrowing were demonstrated in one or more semicircular canals on computed tomography CT scan, with a signal loss at corresponding areas on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. In 1 patient, the posterior part of the vestibule was also affected. The posterior canals were affected in most cases (58%), compared with the superior (21%) and lateral canals (16%) or the vestibule (5%). Only 68.4% of the lesions on MR images were also visible on CT scans, suggesting a fibrotic process without calcification. Ears presenting radiologic lesions showed significantly more severe hearing loss (median PTA 104 dB HL) compared with unaffected ears (58 dB HL).
Eight of 9 subjects with the same P51S mutation in the COCH gene showed similar radiologic lesions, affecting the PSCC in the majority of the cases. These radiologic abnormalities occurred in more advanced stages of the otovestibular deterioration, supporting the hypothesis that these lesions might represent the end phase of a low-grade chronic inflammation or protein deposition.

To explore the spectrum of USH2A disease-causing mutations among Scandinavian USH2 cases, patients from 118 unrelated families of which 27 previously had been found to carry mutations in exons 1-21 were subjected to extensive DNA sequence analysis of the full size USH2A gene. Altogether, 122 USH2A DNA sequence alterations were identified of which 57 were predicted to be disease-causing, 7 were considered to be of uncertain pathogenicity and 58 were predicted to be benign variants. Of 36 novel pathogenic USH2A mutations 31 were located in exons 22-73, specific to the long isoform. USH2A mutations were identified in 89/118 (75.4%) families. In 79/89 (88.8%) of these families two pathogenic mutations were identified whereas in 10/89 (11.2%) families the second mutation remained unidentified.

We sequenced the entire gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase in 51 unrelated hyperphenylalaninemia patients from Southern Italy. The entire locus was genotyped in 46 out of 51 hyperphenylalaninemia patients, and 32 different disease-causing mutations were identified. The pathologic nature of two novel gene variants, namely, c.707-2delA and p.Q301P, was demonstrated by in vitro studies. c.707-2delA is a splicing mutation that involves the accepting site of exon 7; it causes the complete skipping of exon 7 and results in the truncated p.T236MfsX60 protein. The second gene variant, p.Q301P, has very low residual enzymatic activity (approximately 4.4%), which may be ascribed, in part, to a low expression level (8-10%). Both the decreased enzyme activity and the low expression level are supported by analysis of the 3D structure of the molecule. The putative structural alterations induced by p.Q301P are compatible with protein instability and perturbance of monomer interactions within dimers and tetramers, although they do not affect the catalytic site. In vivo studies showed tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in the p.Q301P carrier but not in the c.707-2delA carrier. We next investigated genotype-phenotype correlations and found that genotype was a good predictor of phenotype in 76% of patients. However, genotype-phenotype discordance occurred in approximately 25% of our patients, mainly those bearing mutations p.L48S, p.R158Q, p.R261Q and p.P281L.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

28544236,"Essentials The pathophysiology of type 2M von Willebrand disease (VWD) is poorly understood. Sequence variations in type 2M VWD subjects were characterized. A high degree of clinical and laboratory variability exists within type 2M VWD variants. Some type 2M variants may share features of type 2A VWD.
Background von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric coagulation factor that tethers platelets to injured subendothelium. Type 2M von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by a qualitative defect in VWF with preserved multimer distribution. Objectives Through the Zimmerman Program for the Molecular and Clinical Biology for VWD, five VWF sequence variations were studied in subjects diagnosed with type 2M VWD. Methods Bleeding phenotype was assessed using the ISTH bleeding assessment tool. Full-length VWF gene sequencing was performed for each subject. Each variant was placed into a recombinant VWF vector using site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in HEK293T cells as homozygous or heterozygous VWF. Variant expression, collagen binding and platelet GPIbα binding were studied through ELISA assays. Multimer analysis was performed by gel electrophoresis. Results Bleeding scores were elevated for all subjects except for the p.P1162L and p.R1374C variants. Although all had reduced VWF ristocetin cofactor activity/VWF antigen ratios on plasma testing, recombinant VWF did not show a classic type 2M phenotype for any of the five variants. Homozygous expression of variants p.D1283Y, p.R1349C, p.R1374C and p.I1453N was consistent with type 2A VWD, although all had normal expression as heterozygous recombinant VWF. Variant p.P1162L had normal VWF expression and function, consistent with the lack of bleeding symptoms. Conclusions Although originally classified as type 2M VWD, these homozygous recombinant VWF variants do not fulfill complete 2M VWD diagnostic criteria. A better classification schema and improved testing for putative type 2M variants is needed in order to effectively diagnose and treat affected patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
25840971,"Transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients.
We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFβ binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses.
We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFβ heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients.
The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
22899370,"Approximately 15% of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) exhibit a hypermutated genotype accompanied by high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and defects in DNA mismatch repair. These tumours, unlike the majority of colorectal carcinomas, are often diploid, exhibit frequent epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 DNA mismatch repair gene, and have a better clinical prognosis. As an adjunct study to The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium that recently analysed 224 colorectal cancers by whole exome sequencing, we compared the 35 CRCs (15.6%) with a hypermutated genotype to those with a non-hypermutated genotype. We found that 22 (63%) of the hypermutated CRCs exhibited transcriptional silencing of the MLH1 gene, a high frequency of BRAF V600E gene mutations, and infrequent APC and KRAS mutations, a mutational pattern significantly different from their non-hypermutated counterparts. However, the remaining 13 (37%) hypermutated CRCs lacked MLH1 silencing, contained tumours with the highest mutation rates ('ultramutated' CRCs), and exhibited higher incidences of APC and KRAS mutations, but infrequent BRAF mutations. These patterns were confirmed in an independent validation set of 250 exome-sequenced CRCs. Analysis of mRNA and microRNA expression signatures revealed that hypermutated CRCs with MLH1 silencing had greatly reduced levels of WNT signalling and increased BRAF signalling relative to non-hypermutated CRCs. Our findings suggest that hypermutated CRCs include one subgroup with fundamentally different pathways to malignancy than the majority of CRCs. Examination of MLH1 expression status and frequencies of APC, KRAS, and BRAF mutation in CRC may provide a useful diagnostic tool that could supplement the standard microsatellite instability assays and influence therapeutic decisions.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

There was a history of leukemia in the paternal family and two of their siblings presented with low platelet counts and no history of significant bleeding. A microdeletion encompassing exons 1-2 of RUNX1 (outside the cluster region of the Runt Homology domain and the transactivation domain) was detected in six family members using array-CGH and MLPA validation.

22116617,"Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is caused by fetomaternal platelet incompatibility with maternal antibodies crossing the placenta and destroying fetal platelets. Antibodies against human platelet antigen-1a (HPA-1a) and HPA-5b are responsible for the majority of NAIT cases. We observed a suspected NAIT in a newborn with a platelet count of 25 G/l and petechial haemorrhages. Serological analysis of maternal serum revealed an immunisation against αIIbβ3 on paternal platelets only, indicating the presence of an antibody against a new rare alloantigen (Sec(a)) residing on αIIbβ3. The location of Sec(a) on αIIbβ3 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of paternal β3 revealed a single nucleotide exchange (G(1818)T) in exon 11 of the β3 gene (ITGB3), changing Lys(580) (wild-type) to Asn(580) (Sec(a)). Two additional members of the family Sec were typed Sec(a) positive, but none of 300 blood donors. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing Asn(580), but not Lys(580) αIIbβ3, bound anti-Sec(a), which was corroborated by immunoprecipitation. Adhesion of transfected cells onto immobilised fibrinogen showed reduced binding of the Asn(580) variant compared to wild-type αIIbβ3. Analysis of transfected cells with anti-LIBS and PAC-1 antibody showed reduced binding when compared to the wild-type. No such effects were observed with Sec(a) positive platelets, which, however, are heterozygous for the Lys(580)Asn mutation. In this study, we describe a NAIT case caused by maternal alloimmunisation against a new antigen on αIIbβ3. Analysis with mutant transfected cells showed that the Lys(580)Asn mutation responsible for the formation of the Sec(a) antigenic determinant affects αIIbβ3 receptor function.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
27829222,"GLUT1 is the facilitative transporter playing the major role in the internalization of glucose. Basally, GLUT1 resides on vesicles located in a para-golgian area, and is translocated onto the plasmamembrane upon activation of the PI3KC1-AKT pathway. In proliferating cancer cells, which demand a high quantity of glucose for their metabolism, GLUT1 is permanently expressed on the plasmamembrane. This is associated with the abnormal activation of the PI3KC1-AKT pathway, consequent to the mutational activation of PI3KC1 and/or the loss of PTEN. The latter, in fact, could antagonize the phosphorylation of AKT by limiting the availability of Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Here, we asked whether PTEN could control the plasmamembrane expression of GLUT1 also through its protein-phosphatase activity on AKT. Experiments of co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro de-phosphorylation assay with homogenates of cells transgenically expressing the wild type or knocked-down mutants (lipid-phosphatase, protein-phosphatase, or both) isoforms demonstrated that indeed PTEN physically interacts with AKT and drives its dephosphorylation, and so limiting the expression of GLUT1 at the plasmamembrane. We also show that growth factors limit the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate AKT. Our data emphasize the fact that PTEN acts in two distinct steps of the PI3k/AKT pathway to control the expression of GLUT1 at the plasmamembrane and, further, add AKT to the list of the protein substrates of PTEN.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
22729223,"De novo somatic mutations in focal areas are well documented in diseases such as neoplasia but are rarely reported in malformation of the developing brain. Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Patients with SLC26A4 mutations have variable phenotypes ranging from non-syndromic hearing loss to Pendred syndrome. Here, we analyzed the correlation between genotype and various inner ear phenotypes and found a possible underlying mechanism. This study included 111 patients with bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations who had bilateral enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and hearing loss. p.H723R (61%), c.919-2A>G (24%), and p.T410M (4%) were the most common mutations in Korean patients with EVAs. Residual hearing in patients with c.919-2A>G or p.T410M mutations was better than that of patients with p.H723R homozygous mutations. Interestingly, quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed normal pendrin transcript (6-17% of normal levels) was produced from patients with c.919-2A>G homozygous mutations. Surface expression ratio of pendrin and residual anion exchange activity were higher in cells transfected with p.T410M in comparison to cells transfected with p.H723R.

19431188,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is the gene mutated in the cancer-predisposing disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We modeled ATM sequence variants identified in UK A-T patients to determine the stability and kinase activity of the resulting proteins as well as the distribution of these mutations across the coding region. Of 20 missense changes modeled, 10 proteins showed ATM kinase activity and 10 showed none. In the majority of cases the mutant ATM protein was unstable, although this was variable. Reduction in ATM kinase activity can result either from the presence of low levels of unstable mutant protein with relatively normal specific kinase activity or from stable mutant protein with deficient ATM kinase activation. Indeed, ATM mutant proteins without kinase activity toward downstream targets were still able to autophosphorylate on serine 1981, although in a much less efficient manner, suggesting that this was not sufficient for ATM activation. In terms of function, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged kinase inactive ATM proteins could form ionizing radiation (IR)-induced foci (IRIF), at least temporarily, which colocalized with the DNA double-strand break (DSB) marker gammaH2AX. Consistent with this, both kinase active and inactive mutant ATM proteins were able to interfere with phosphorylation of targets by endogenous ATM. Since the majority of missense mutations occurred C-terminal to aa1966, including all 10 mutations with absence of kinase activity, the implication was that mutations N-terminal to this, with exceptions, are less likely to result in loss of kinase activity and therefore, are less likely to be identified in A-T patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

This study describes the molecular genetic analyses of 19 patients with GT who were diagnosed on the basis of clinical parameters and platelet analyses. The patients' bleeding signs include epistaxis, mucocutaneous bleeding, haematomas, petechiae, gastrointestinal bleeding, and menorrhagia. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ITGA2B or ITGB3 were identified as causing GT by sequencing of genomic DNA. All exons including exon/intron boundaries of both genes were analysed. In a patient with an intronic mutation, splicing of mRNA was analysed using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR of platelet-derived RNA. In short, 16 of 19 patients revealed 27 different mutations (ITGA2B: n=17, ITGB3: n=10). Seventeen of these mutations have not been published to date. Mutations in ITGA2B or ITGB3 were identified as causing GT in 16 patients. We detected a total of 27 mutations in ITGA2B and ITGB3 including 17 novel missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice site mutations. In addition, three patients revealed no molecular genetic anomalies in ITGA2B or ITGB3 that could explain the suspected diagnosis of GT. We assume that these patients may harbour defects in a regulatory element affecting the transcription of these genes, or other proteins may exist that are important for activating the αIIbβ3 complex that may be affected.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
9763559,"To clarify a molecular defect responsible for moderate alphaIIb beta3 deficiency, we examined two unrelated patients, MT and MS, suffering from type II and type I Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), respectively. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments derived from platelet mRNA showed a single A-->C substitution at nucleotide (nt) 2334 leading to a Gln747--> Pro in alphaIIb in both patients. Allele-specific restriction enzyme analysis (ASRA) of genomic DNA demonstrated that patient MT was homozygous for the Gln747-->Pro substitution and patient MS was compound heterozygous for this substitution and for an RNA splice mutation at the consensus sequence of the splice acceptor site of exon 18 (AG-->AA). Furthermore, ASRA showed that, among 17 unrelated Japanese GT patients, this Gln747-->Pro substitution was detected in 4 patients, including MT and MS (homozygous, 2 patients; heterozygous, 2 patients). Cotransfection of Pro747alphaIIb and beta3 constructs into 293 cells resulted in moderate reduction in the amount of alphaIIb beta3 within the transfected cells as well as on the cell surface. However, Pro747alphaIIb beta3 bound the ligand mimetic monoclonal antibody (MoAb) PAC-1 after activation of alphaIIb beta3 by the MoAb PT25-2, suggesting that the mutant alphaIIb beta3 possesses the ligand-binding function. The association between the mutant proalphaIIb and beta3 was not disturbed. Surface labeling and pulse chase study showed that the Gln747-->Pro substitution moderately impaired both intracellular transport of the alphaIIb beta3 heterodimers to the Golgi apparatus and endoproteolytic cleavage of proalphaIIb into heavy and light chains. By contrast, replacement of Gln747 with Ala by mutagenesis did not impair alphaIIbbeta3 expression on the cell surface. These results suggest that the presence of Pro, rather than the absence of Gln, at amino acid residue 747 on alphaIIb is responsible for moderate alphaIIbbeta3 deficiency.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
11328726,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and the most severe form of all inherited retinal dystrophies. In 1996, the current investigators ascribed the disease in families linked to the LCA1 locus on chromosome 17p13.1 to mutations in the photoreceptor-specific guanylyl cyclase (retGC-1) gene. So far, 22 different mutations, of which 11 are missense mutations, have been identified in 25 unrelated families. This is a report of the functional analyses of nine of the missense mutations.
cDNA constructs were generated that contained the retGC-1 missense mutations identified in patients related to the LCA1 locus. Mutants were expressed in COS7 cells and assayed for their ability to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
All mutations lying in the catalytic domain showed a complete abolition of cyclase activity. In contrast, only one mutation lying in the extracellular domain also resulted in a severely reduced catalytic activity, whereas the others showed completely normal activity.
More than half the mutations identified in patients related to the LCA1 locus are truncating mutations expected to result in a total abolition of retGC-1 activity. Concerning missense mutations, half of them lying in the catalytic domain of the protein also result in the complete inability of the mutant cyclases to hydrolyze GTP into cGMP in vitro. In contrast, missense mutations lying in the extracellular domain, except one affecting the initiation codon, showed normal catalytic activity of retGC-1. Nevertheless, considering that all patients related to the LCA1 locus displayed the same phenotype, it can be assumed that all missense mutations would have the same dramatic consequences on protein activity in vivo as truncation mutations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The role of the allelic variant M34T in causing hereditary deafness remains controversial. By combining genetic, clinical, biochemical, electrophysiological and structural modeling studies, we have re-assessed the pathogenetic role of the M34T mutation. Genetic and audiological data indicate that the majority of heterozygous carriers and all five compound heterozygotes exhibited an impaired auditory function. Functional expression in transiently transfected HeLa cells showed that, although M34T was correctly synthesized and targeted to the plasma membrane, it inefficiently formed intercellular channels that displayed an abnormal electrical behavior and retained only 11% of the unitary conductance of the wild-type protein (HCx26wt). Moreover, M34T channels failed to support the intercellular diffusion of Lucifer Yellow and the spreading of mechanically induced intercellular Ca2+ waves. When co-expressed together with HCx26wt, M34T exerted dominant-negative effects on cell-cell coupling. Our findings are consistent with a structural model, predicting that the mutation leads to a constriction of the channel pore. These data support the view that M34T is a pathological variant of Cx26 associated with hearing impairment.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Due to limited methods for the definite diagnosis of ITP, genetic and clinical parameters are required for diagnosing inherited thrombocytopenias with small or normal-sized platelets.
In total, 32 Japanese patients with thrombocytopenia with small or normal-sized platelets from 29 families were enrolled. All the patients were under 20 years of age, with family histories of early-onset thrombocytopenia and/or poor response to conventional therapies for ITP. Genotypes and clinical parameters were retrospectively evaluated according to the disease type.
Twelve cases of inherited thrombocytopenia were observed. We identified chromosomal deletions within the WASP gene in two patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; a missense mutation in a patient with X-linked thrombocytopenia; and mutations in the RUNX1 gene of five patients with familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myelogenous leukemia, and in the ANKRD26 gene of four patients with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia-2. All 12 carried germline mutations, three of which were de novo. Furthermore, we observed significantly elevated serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels and dysplasia of megakaryocytes in patients carrying the RUNX1 and ANKRD26 mutations.
Genetic analyses and detection of TPO levels and dysmegakaryopoiesis were clinically useful for screening patients with inherited thrombocytopenias, irrespective of the family history.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether mutations in the SLC26A4 gene cause Mondini deformity without an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (isolated Mondini deformity) in a Chinese population.
In total, 144 patients with sensorineural hearing loss were included and subjected to high-resolution temporal bone CT. Among them, 28 patients with isolated Mondini dysplasia (MD group), 50 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct with Mondini dysplasia (EVA with MD group), 50 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct without Mondini dysplasia (EVA group), and 16 patients with other types of inner ear malformations (IEM group) were identified. The coding exons of SLC26A4 were analyzed in all subjects.
DNA sequence analysis of SLC26A4 was performed in all 144 patients. In the different groups, the detection rate of the SLC26A4 mutation differed. In the isolated MD group, only one single allelic mutation in SLC26A4 was found in one patient (1/28, 3.6%). In the EVA with MD group, biallelic and monoallelic SLC26A4 mutations were identified in 46 patients (46/50, 92.0%) and three patients (3/50, 6.0%), respectively. Also, in the EVA group, biallelic and monoallelic SLC26A4 mutations were identified in 46 patients (46/50, 92.0%) and three patients (3/50, 6.0%), respectively. These percentages were identical to those in the EVA plus MD group. Only two patients carried monoallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene in the IEM group (2/16, 12.5%). There were significant differences in the frequency of SLC26A4 mutation among the groups (P<0.001).

Countrywide collection of patients with CHI included 40 subjects (12 females, median age of diagnosis, 1 wk [interquartile range, 1-612 wk]). We sequenced the ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, UCP2, SLC16A1, HNF4A, and HNF1A genes and investigated structural changes in the ABCC8 gene. We functionally tested novel variants in the ABCC8 gene by Rb(86+) efflux assay and novel variants in the HNF1A gene by transcriptional activation and DNA-binding tests.
We found causal mutations in 20 subjects (50%): 19 carried a heterozygous mutation while one patient was homozygous for mutation in the ABCC8 gene. Specifically, we detected 11 mutations (seven novel) in ABCC8, one novel mutation in KCNJ11, five mutations (two novel) in HNF1A, two novel mutations in HNF4A, and one in GCK. We showed a decrease of activation by diazoxide in mutant KATP channels with novel ABCC8 variants by 41-91% (median, 82%) compared with wild-type (WT) channels and reduced transcriptional activity of mutant HNF1A proteins (2.9% for p.Asn62Lysfs93* and 22% for p.Leu254Gln) accompanied by no DNA-binding ability compared with WT HNF1A.
We detected a higher proportion of heterozygous mutations causing CHI compared with other cohorts probably due to lack of consanguinity and inclusion of milder CHI forms. Interestingly, HNF1A gene mutations represented the second most frequent genetic cause of CHI in the Czech Republic. Based on our results we present a genetic testing strategy specific for similar populations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
28439001,"Unconventional myosin 7a (Myo7a), myosin 7b (Myo7b), and myosin 15a (Myo15a) all contain MyTH4-FERM domains (myosin tail homology 4-band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin; MF) in their cargo binding tails and are essential for the growth and function of microvilli and stereocilia. Numerous mutations have been identified in the MyTH4-FERM tandems of these myosins in patients suffering visual and hearing impairment. Although a number of MF domain binding partners have been identified, the molecular basis of interactions with the C-terminal MF domain (CMF) of these myosins remains poorly understood. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of Myo7b CMF in complex with the extended PDZ3 domain of USH1C (a.k.a., Harmonin), revealing a previously uncharacterized interaction mode both for MyTH4-FERM tandems and for PDZ domains. We predicted, based on the structure of the Myo7b CMF/USH1C PDZ3 complex, and verified that Myo7a CMF also binds to USH1C PDZ3 using a similar mode. The structure of the Myo7b CMF/USH1C PDZ complex provides mechanistic explanations for >20 deafness-causing mutations in Myo7a CMF. Taken together, these findings suggest that binding to PDZ domains, such as those from USH1C, PDZD7, and Whirlin, is a common property of CMFs of Myo7a, Myo7b, and Myo15a.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
23601496,"To evaluate whether B-cell depletion before enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) initiation can block acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) antibody responses and improve clinical outcomes.
Six subjects with Pompe disease (including 4 cross-reacting immunologic material-negative infants) aged 2-8 months received rituximab and sirolimus or mycophenolate before ERT. Four subjects continued to receive sirolimus, rituximab every 12 weeks, and intravenous immunoglobulin monthly for the duration of ERT. Sirolimus trough levels, IgG, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, C-reactive protein, platelets, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were measured regularly.
Immunomodulation achieved B-cell depletion without adverse effects. After 17-36 months of rituximab, sirolimus and ERT, all subjects lacked antibodies against GAA, 4 continued to gain motor milestones, yet 2 progressed to require invasive ventilation. The absence of infusion-associated reactions allowed the use of accelerated infusion rates.
B-cell depletion and T-cell immunomodulation in infants naïve to ERT was accomplished safely and eliminated immune responses against GAA, thereby optimizing clinical outcome; however, this approach did not necessarily influence sustained independent ventilation. Importantly, study outcomes support the initiation of immunomodulation before starting ERT, because the study regimen allowed for prompt initiation of treatment.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
20683980,"Noonan syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by congenital heart defects, short stature, and characteristic facial features. Familial or de novo mutations in PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1, KRAS, and NRAS are responsible for 60-75% of the cases, thus, additional genes are expected to be involved in the pathogenesis. In addition, the genotype-phenotype correlation has been hindered by the highly variable expressivity of the disease. For all these reasons, expanding the genotyped and clinically evaluated case numbers will benefit the clinical community. A mutation analysis has been performed on RAF1, SOS1, and GRB2, in 24 patients previously found to be negative for PTPN11 and KRAS mutations. We identified four mutations in SOS1 and one in RAF1, while no GRB2 variants have been found. Interestingly, the RAF1 mutation was present in a patient also carrying a newly identified p.R497Q familial SOS1 mutation, segregating with a typical Noonan Syndrome SOS1 cutaneous phenotype. Functional analysis demonstrated that the R497Q SOS1 mutation leads to Jnk activation, but has no effect on the Ras effector Erk1. We propose that this variant might contribute to the onset of the peculiar ectodermal traits displayed by the propositus amidst the more classical Noonan syndrome presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient harboring mutations in two genes, with an involvement of both Ras and Rac1 pathways, indicating that SOS1 may have a role of modifier gene that might contribute the variable expressivity of the disease, evidencing a genotype-phenotype correlation in the family.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
19023448,"Usher syndrome type II (USH2) is the most common form of Usher syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe hearing loss, postpuberal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and normal vestibular function. Mutations in the USH2A gene have been shown to be responsible for most cases of USH2. To further elucidate the role of USH2A in USH2, mutation screening was undertaken in three Chinese families with USH2.
Three unrelated Chinese families, consisting of six patients and 10 unaffected relatives, were examined clinically, and 100 normal Chinese individuals served as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from the venous blood of all participants. The coding region (exons 2-72), including the intron-exon boundary of USH2A, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products amplified from the three probands were analyzed using direct sequencing to screen sequence variants. Whenever substitutions were identified in a patient, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, or single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was performed on all available family members and the control group.
Fundus examination revealed typical fundus features of RP, including narrowing of the vessels, bone-speckle pigmentation, and waxy optic discs. The ERG wave amplitudes of three probands were undetectable. Audiometric tests indicated moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment. Vestibular function was normal. Five novel mutations (one small insertion, one small deletion, one nonsense, one missense, and one splice site) were detected in three families after sequence analysis of USH2A. Of the five mutations, four were located in exons 22-72, specific to the long isoform of USH2A.
The mutations found in our study broaden the spectrum of USH2A mutations. Our results further indicate that the long isoform of USH2A may harbor even more mutations of the USH2A gene.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

This study reports the results of an upfront diagnostic strategy using targeted whole exome sequencing. In total, 156 patients with a significant bleeding assessment tool score participated in the study, of which a third had thrombocytopenia. Eighty-seven genes specifically associated with genetic predisposition to bleeding were analysed by whole exome sequencing. Variants were classified according to the five-tier scheme. We identified 353 germline variants. Eight patients (5%) harboured a known pathogenic variant. Of the 345 previously unknown variants, computational analyses predicted 99 to be significant. Further filtration according to the Mendelian inheritance pattern, resulted in 59 variants being predicted to be clinically significant. Moreover, 34% (20/59) were assigned as novel class 4 or 5 variants upon targeted functional testing. A class 4 or 5 variant was identified in 30% of patients with thrombocytopenia (14/47) versus 11% of patients with a normal platelet count (12/109) (P < 0·01). An IBD diagnosis has a major clinical impact. The genetic investigations detailed here extricated our patients from a diagnostic conundrum, thus demonstrating that continuous optimization of the diagnostic work-up of IBD is of great benefit.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
2014036,"Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that results from a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Its clinical phenotype varies widely, and to date more than 10 mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene have been identified in persons with the disorder. We attempted to relate the clinical phenotype of patients to their genotype.
We studied 258 patients with phenylketonuria from Denmark and Germany for the presence of eight mutations previously found in patients from these countries. The in vitro activity of the enzymes associated with these mutations was determined by expression analysis in heterologous mammalian cells. The level of activity was then used to predict the in vivo level of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in patients with various combinations of mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles.
The eight mutations involved 64 percent of all mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in the patients. Expression analysis showed that these mutant enzymes produced from 0 to 50 percent of normal enzyme activity. The predicted level of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity correlated strongly with the pretreatment serum level of phenylalanine (r = 0.91, P less than 0.001 in the Danish patients and r = 0.74, P less than 0.001 in the German patients), phenylalanine tolerance in the Danish patients (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001), and the serum phenylalanine level measured after standardized oral protein loading in the German patients (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001).
Our results strongly support the hypothesis that there is a molecular basis for phenotypic heterogeneity in phenylketonuria. The establishment of genotype will therefore aid in the prediction of biochemical and clinical phenotypes in patients with this disease.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Screening for sequence variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha (MODY1), glucokinase (MODY2), HNF-1alpha (MODY3) genes and mitochondrial DNA was carried out in 115 Finnish and Swedish patients with early-onset ( </= 40 years) diabetes using the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique and direct sequencing. Allele frequencies were compared with 118 patients with onset of diabetes Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus after the age of 40 and 92 non-diabetic control subjects without a family history of diabetes.
In total 52 sequence variants were found in the HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and glucokinase genes, 12 of which were considered as MODY mutations. Three families had the A3243G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) gene, which resulted in an overall prevalence of these mutations of 13 %.
Among 115 Scandinavian families, mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene represented the most common cause of familial early-onset ( </= 40 years) diabetes: MODY3 (5.2 %) more than MODY2 (3.5 %) more than MIDD (2.6 %) more than MODY1 (1.7 %).",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

22739344,"The Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) gene has been implicated in severe Rett-like phenotypes. It encodes the Forkhead box protein G1, a winged-helix transcriptional repressor critical for forebrain development. Recently, the core FOXG1 syndrome was defined as postnatal microcephaly, severe mental retardation, absent language, dyskinesia, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. We present seven additional patients with a severe Rett-like neurodevelopment disorder associated with de novo FOXG1 point mutations (two cases) or 14q12 deletions (five cases). We expand the mutational spectrum in patients with FOXG1-related encephalopathies and precise the core FOXG1 syndrome phenotype. Dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and dyskinesia are not always present in FOXG1-mutated patients. We believe that the FOXG1 gene should be considered in severely mentally retarded patients (no speech-language) with severe acquired microcephaly (-4 to-6 SD) and few clinical features suggestive of Rett syndrome. Interestingly enough, three 14q12 deletions that do not include the FOXG1 gene are associated with phenotypes very reminiscent to that of FOXG1-mutation-positive patients. We physically mapped a putative long-range FOXG1-regulatory element in a 0.43 Mb DNA segment encompassing the PRKD1 locus. In fibroblast cells, a cis-acting regulatory sequence located more than 0.6 Mb away from FOXG1 acts as a silencer at the transcriptional level. These data are important for clinicians and for molecular biologists involved in the management of patients with severe encephalopathies compatible with a FOXG1-related phenotype.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
20373070,"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is the only known cancer syndrome that is dominated by gastric adenocarcinoma. HDGC is caused by germline mutation of the CDH1 gene that encodes the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Mutation carriers have a more than 70% lifetime risk of developing DGC and an elevated risk of lobular breast cancer. Intestinal-type gastric cancer is not part of the syndrome. Clinical management of HDGC involves predictive genetic testing beginning at or near 16 years of age. It is recommended that mutation carriers undergo prophylactic gastrectomy after about 20 years of age. Anatomical mapping has demonstrated that mutation carriers develop multifocal stage T1a signet ring cell carcinomas, with up to several hundred foci being observed in single stomachs. These foci develop following the somatic inactivation of the second CDH1 allele by mechanisms that include DNA promoter hypermethylation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

In order to provide high quality genetic testing to eyeGENE(®)'s enrolled patients which potentially aids clinical diagnosis and disease treatment, we carried out a pilot study and performed Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based molecular diagnosis for 105 Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients randomly selected from the network. A custom capture panel was designed, which incorporated 195 known retinal disease genes, including 61 known RP genes. As a result, disease-causing mutations were identified in 52 out of 105 probands (solving rate of 49.5%). A total of 82 mutations were identified, and 48 of them were novel. Interestingly, for three probands the molecular diagnosis was inconsistent with the initial clinical diagnosis, while for five probands the molecular information suggested a different inheritance model other than that assigned by the physician. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NGS target sequencing is efficient and sufficiently precise for molecular diagnosis of a highly heterogeneous patient cohort from eyeGENE(®).",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Routine genetic screening of HCM patients for specific mutations is anticipated to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. The frequency and associated phenotype of these mutations in a large, unselected cohort of HCM is unknown.
A total of 293 unrelated HCM patients were genotyped for the presence of a benign mutation. DNA was obtained after informed consent; specific MHY7, TNNT2, and TPM1 fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction; and the mutations were detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated DNA sequencing. Only 5 (1.7%) of the 293 patients possessed a benign mutation. Moreover, all 5 subjects with an ascribed benign mutation had already manifested clinically severe expression of HCM, with all 5 requiring surgical myectomy, 3 of the 5 having a family history of sudden cardiac death, and 1 adolescent requiring an orthotopic heart transplant.
These findings demonstrate the rarity of specific mutations in HCM and challenge the notion of mutation-specific clinical outcomes. Fewer than 2% of the subjects harbored a benign mutation, and those patients with a benign mutation experienced a very serious clinical course.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

To report on initial clinical indications for CES referrals and molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and for different test types.
Clinical exome sequencing was performed on 814 consecutive patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions at the University of California, Los Angeles, Clinical Genomics Center between January 2012 and August 2014. Clinical exome sequencing was conducted as trio-CES (both parents and their affected child sequenced simultaneously) to effectively detect de novo and compound heterozygous variants or as proband-CES (only the affected individual sequenced) when parental samples were not available.
Clinical indications for CES requests, molecular diagnostic rates of CES overall and for phenotypic subgroups, and differences in molecular diagnostic rates between trio-CES and proband-CES.
Of the 814 cases, the overall molecular diagnosis rate was 26% (213 of 814; 95% CI, 23%-29%). The molecular diagnosis rate for trio-CES was 31% (127 of 410 cases; 95% CI, 27%-36%) and 22% (74 of 338 cases; 95% CI, 18%-27%) for proband-CES. In cases of developmental delay in children (<5 years, n = 138), the molecular diagnosis rate was 41% (45 of 109; 95% CI, 32%-51%) for trio-CES cases and 9% (2 of 23, 95% CI, 1%-28%) for proband-CES cases. The significantly higher diagnostic yield (P value = .002; odds ratio, 7.4 [95% CI, 1.6-33.1]) of trio-CES was due to the identification of de novo and compound heterozygous variants.

25688877,"Familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH) is a relatively rare but fatal disorder characterized by elevated arterial pressure caused by abnormal proliferation of endothelial cells of the arteries, which eventually leads to heart failure and death. FPAH is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the BMPR2 gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2). BMPR2 belongs to the TGF β/BMP super-family of receptors involved in a signal transduction cascade via the SMAD signaling pathway. The BMPR2 polypeptide is composed of 1038 amino acids and consists of a ligand binding domain, a kinase domain and a cytoplasmic tail. To investigate the cellular and functional consequence of BMPR2 mutations, C-terminally FLAG-tagged constructs of eighteen pathogenic BMPR2 missense mutants were generated by site directed mutagenesis and expressed in HeLa and HEK-293T cell lines. The subcellular localizations of the mutant proteins were investigated using immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Post-translational modifications of the proteins were analyzed by Endoglycosidase H deglycosylation assay. Our results indicated that mutations in the ligand binding domain affecting highly conserved cysteine residues resulted in retention of the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as evident from their co-localization with the ER resident protein calnexin. The kinase domain mutants showed both ER and plasma membrane (PM) distributions, while the cytoplasmic tail domain variants were localized exclusively to the PM. The subcellular localizations of the mutants were further confirmed by their characteristic glycosylation profiles. In conclusion, our results indicate that ER quality control (ERQC) is involved in the pathological mechanism of several BMPR2 receptor missense mutations causing FPAH, which can be explored as a potential therapeutic target in the future.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Mutation screening was prospectively performed in 814 acute myeloid leukemia patients. At diagnosis, 211/814 (25.9%) patients harbored mutations with a median clone size of 39% (range: 2-96%). Furthermore, in 57 patients paired samples from diagnosis and relapse were analyzed. In 47/57 (82.5%) cases the same alterations detected at diagnosis were present at relapse, whereas in 1/57 (1.8%) cases the mutation from the diagnostic sample was no longer detectable. Discrepancies were observed in 9/57 (15.8%) cases, also including the occurrence of novel RUNX1 mutations not restricted to those regions affected at diagnosis. Moreover, in 103 patients the prognostic impact of residual levels of RUNX1 mutations during complete remission was studied. Separation of patients according to median residual mutation burden into 'good responders' and 'poor responders' (median: 3.61%; range: 0.03-48.0%) resulted in significant differences of both event-free (median 21.0 vs. 5.7 months, P<0.001) and overall survival (OS; median 56.9 vs. 32.0 months, P=0.002).

The phenotype is variable, and limited genotype phenotype correlation exists with SOS1 mutations often associated with normal cognition and stature, RAF1 mutations entailing a high HCM risk, and certain PTPN11 mutations predisposing to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recently identified SHOC2 mutation (p.Ser2Gly) causes Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. We report five patients with this mutation. All had skin hyperpigmentation, sparse light colored hair, increased fine wrinkles, ligamentous laxity, developmental delay, and 4/4 had a structural cardiac anomaly. Hypotonia and macrocephaly occurred in 4/5 (80%); 3/5 (60%) had polyhydramnios, increased birth weight or required use of a feeding tube. Distinctive brain abnormalities included relative megalencephaly and enlarged subarachnoid spaces suggestive of benign external hydrocephalus, and a relatively small posterior fossa as indicated by a vertical tentorium. The combination of a large brain with a small posterior fossa likely resulted in the high rate of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (3/4; 75%). Periventricular nodular heterotopia was seen in one patient with a thick and dysplastic corpus callosum. We report on the first hematologic neoplasm, myelofibrosis, in a 2-year-old patient with SHOC2 mutation. Myelofibrosis is exceedingly rare in children and young adults.

In this study, profiles of adaptive behavior of individuals with CFC and NS who had confirmed pathogenic mutations in Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes were investigated. Patterns of strengths and weaknesses, age-related differences, and risk factors for difficulties in adaptive skills were assessed. Although genes acting more downstream in the Ras/MAPK pathway were associated with more difficulties in adaptive functioning than genes more upstream in the pathway, several inconsistencies highlight the wide spectrum of possible developmental courses in CFC and NS. Along with clinical and genetic factors, variables such as chronological age, gestational age at birth, and parental education levels accounted for significant variance in adaptive skills. Results indicate that there is wide heterogeneity in adaptive functioning in CFC and NS, but that these abilities are correlated to some extent with the specific disease-causing genes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
17551924,"Because Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome has significant phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome, it may be difficult to establish the diagnosis on a clinical basis. The recent discoveries of germline HRAS mutations in patients with Costello syndrome and mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 in CFC syndrome uncovered the biologic mechanism for the shared phenotypic findings based on the close interaction of the affected gene products within the MAP kinase pathway. We evaluated a series of patients who were either clinically diagnosed with Costello syndrome, or in whom the diagnoses of both Costello and CFC syndromes were considered. After excluding mutations in HRAS, we identified eight changes in BRAF and five in MEK1. Five mutations are novel, and all changes occurred de novo among those triads tested. A review of the clinical abnormalities showed important differences between patients with either a BRAF or MEK1 mutation, and those previously reported with an HRAS mutation. Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of patients with BRAF and MEK1 mutations reported here, for polyhydramnios, growth hormone deficiency and the presence of more than one papilloma, which were less common in CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients. Although both CFC and Costello syndrome are characterized by cardiac abnormalities in about three-fourths of patients, the pattern of congenital heart defects (CHD), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and tachycardia differs somewhat. CHD, especially pulmonic stenosis associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect, are more common in CFC than Costello syndrome (P = 0.02). Atrial tachycardia is less frequent in CFC patients with BRAF or MEK1 mutations, compared to Costello syndrome patients with HRAS mutation (P = 0.04). Chaotic atrial rhythm or multifocal atrial tachycardia was observed only in Costello syndrome. Malignant tumors have been viewed as characteristic for Costello syndrome due to HRAS mutations, however, we report here on a MEK1 mutation in a patient with a malignant tumor, a hepatoblastoma. Although this indicates that the presence of a tumor is not specific for Costello syndrome with HRAS mutation, it is noteworthy that the tumor histology differs from those commonly seen in Costello syndrome. Based on these clinical differences we suggest that patients with BRAF and MEK mutations should be diagnosed with CFC syndrome, and the diagnosis of Costello syndrome be reserved for patients with HRAS mutations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

After thalassemia, PKU is considered as the most common autosomal recessive diseases in the Iranian population. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic strategy is required to identify disease-causing mutations in this population. Following our first report in 2003, here we presented a comprehensive study on the mutation spectrum of the PAH gene in the Iranian population. This study was performed on 280 unrelated chromosomes from 140 Iranian patients with classic PKU. All 13 exons as well as exon-intron boundaries of the PAH gene were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. Thirty four different mutations were identified by a mutation detection rate of 100%. IVS10-11G > A, p.P281L, R261Q, p.F39del and IVS11+1G > C were the most prevalent mutations with frequencies of 26.07%, 19.3%, 12.86%, 6.07 and 3.93%, respectively.

We hypothesized that CpG doublets could represent mutation hot spots in PAH deficiencies and we carried out the systematic sequence analysis of exon 7 in 20 unrelated PAH-deficient kindreds of Mediterranean ancestry. This procedure resulted in the detection of two novel missense mutations whose location and nature (CG to CA and CG to TG) were consistent with the accidental deamination of a 5-methylcytosine in a CpG doublet (codon 261arg----gln and codon 252arg----trp). Moreover, the codon 261 mutation was found to be associated with mutant restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotype 1, the most frequent mutant RFLP haplotype at the PAH locus in the studies reported thus far. However, since the mutation was detected in only 36% of haplotype 1 mutant alleles, it appears that this haplotype at the PAH locus is genotypically heterogeneous in Mediterranean countries.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

A broad range of studies have been published focusing on Pompe patients from different countries, but none from Brazil. We investigated 41 patients with either infantile-onset (21 cases) or late-onset (20 cases) disease by muscle pathology, enzyme activity and GAA gene mutation screening. Molecular analyses identified 71 mutant alleles from the probands, nine of which are novel (five missense mutations c.136T > G, c.650C > T, c.1456G > C, c.1834C > T, and c.1905C > A, a splice-site mutation c.1195-2A > G, two deletions c.18_25del and c.2185delC, and one nonsense mutation c.643G > T). Interestingly, the c.1905C > A variant was detected in four unrelated patients and may represent a common Brazilian Pompe mutation. The c.2560C > T severe mutation was frequent in our population suggesting a high prevalence in Brazil. Also, eight out of the 21 infantile-onset patients have two truncating mutations predicted to abrogate protein expression. Of the ten late-onset patients who do not carry the common late-onset intronic mutation c.-32-13T > G, five (from three separate families) carry the recently described intronic mutation, c.-32-3C > A, and one sibpair carries the novel missense mutation c.1781G > C in combination with known severe mutation c.1941C > G. The association of these variants (c.1781G > C and c.-32-3C > A) with late-onset disease suggests that they allow for some residual activity in these patients.

All parents were unaffected.
The alpha-skeletal muscle actin gene (ACTA1) was sequenced. Available muscle biopsies were investigated by standard histological and electron microscopic techniques. The expression of various proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, or both.
Three homozygous ACTA1 null mutations were identified: p.Arg41X in the French patient, p.Tyr364fsX in the Spanish patient, and p.Asp181fsX10 in all five British patients. An absence of alpha-skeletal muscle actin protein but presence of alpha-cardiac actin was shown in all muscle biopsies examined, with more alpha-cardiac actin in the biopsy from the child with the greatest muscle function. Muscle biopsies from all patients exhibited nemaline bodies whereas three also contained zebra bodies.
The seven patients have recessive nemaline myopathy caused by absence of alpha-skeletal muscle actin.

A total of 79 different mutations were identified in 405 of 424 mutant PAH alleles including 15 novel ones.

The mutation spectrum of the PAH gene in PKU patients in Israel is described, along with a discussion on genotype-phenotype correlations. By using polymerase chain reaction/denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (PCR/dHPLC) and DNA sequencing, we screened all exons of the PAH gene in 180 unrelated patients with four different PKU phenotypes [classic PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP)]. In 63.2% of patient genotypes, the metabolic phenotype could be predicted, though evidence is also found for both phenotypic inconsistencies among subjects with more than one type of mutation in the PAH gene. Data analysis revealed that about 25% of patients could participate in the future in (6R)-L: -erythro-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment trials according to their mutation genotypes.

Clinically, the Dutch family differs from the original DFNA9 family by a later age at onset and a more clearly established vestibular impairment. A gene that is highly and specifically expressed in the human fetal cochlea and vestibule, COCH (previously described as Coch5B2 ), was mapped to the DFNA9 critical region. Sequence analysis revealed a 208C-->T mutation in the COCH gene, resulting in a Pro51Ser substitution in the predicted protein in all affected individuals of the family but not in unaffected family members and 200 control individuals. The same mutation was also identified in three apparently unrelated families with a similar phenotype, suggesting the presence of a Dutch founder mutation. The function of COCH is unknown but several characteristics of the protein point to a structural role in the extracellular matrix. The mutant serine at position 51 is situated between cysteines and possibly interferes with proper COCH protein folding or its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by profound congenital sensorineural deafness, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular abnormalities. Mutations in the myosin VIIA gene (MYO7A) are responsible for Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B). This gene is thought to bear greatest responsibility for USH1 and, depending on the study, has been reported to account for between 24% and 59% of USH1 cases. In this report a mutation screening of the MYO7A gene was carried out in a series of 48 unrelated USH1 families using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and direct sequencing of those fragments showed an abnormal electrophoretic pattern. Twenty-five mutations were identified in 23 out of the 48 families studied (47.9%). Twelve of these mutations were novel, including five missense mutations, three premature stop codons, three frameshift, and one putative splice-site mutation.

Here, we use an in silico analysis to predict the analytic sensitivity of WES using pathogenic variants identified on targeted NGS panels as a reference.
Corresponding nucleotide positions for 1533 different alterations classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic identified on targeted NGS multi-gene panel tests in our laboratory were interrogated in data from 100 randomly-selected clinical WES samples to quantify the sequence coverage at each position. Pathogenic variants represented 91 genes implicated in hereditary cancer, X-linked intellectual disability, primary ciliary dyskinesia, Marfan syndrome/aortic aneurysms, cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias.
When assessing coverage among 100 individual WES samples for each pathogenic variant (153,300 individual assessments), 99.7% (n = 152,798) would likely have been detected on WES. All pathogenic variants had at least some coverage on exome sequencing, with a total of 97.3% (n = 1491) detectable across all 100 individuals. For the remaining 42 pathogenic variants, the number of WES samples with adequate coverage ranged from 35 to 99. Factors such as location in GC-rich, repetitive, or homologous regions likely explain why some of these alterations were not detected across all samples. To validate study findings, a similar analysis was performed against coverage data from 60,706 exomes available through the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Results from this validation confirmed that 98.6% (91,743,296/93,062,298) of pathogenic variants demonstrated adequate depth for detection.

We generated mice with endothelial-specific, inducible expression of an RAF1 gene with a gain-of-function mutation (RAF1(S259A)) that is associated with Noonan syndrome. Expression of mutant RAF1(S259A) in ECs activated ERK and induced SOX18 and PROX1 expression, leading to increased commitment of venous ECs to the lymphatic fate. Excessive production of lymphatic ECs resulted in lymphangiectasia that was highly reminiscent of abnormal lymphatics seen in Noonan syndrome and similar ""RASopathies."" Inhibition of ERK signaling during development abrogated the lymphatic differentiation program and rescued the lymphatic phenotypes induced by expression of RAF1(S259A).

Primary dysfunction of PAH caused by mutations in the PAH gene results in hyperphenylalaninemia, which may impair cognitive development unless corrected by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. The mechanism(s) by which PAH missense mutations cause enzyme impairment has been studied in detail only in a small number of cases, but existing evidence points to a major role of enhanced proteolytic degradation due to aberrant folding of mutant polypeptides. We have used two heterologous in vitro expression systems (a mammalian cell-free transcription-translation system and the pET system of Escherichia coli) to examine 34 mutations that have been associated with PAH deficiency in the Danish population. These mutations represent a broad range of amino acid substitutions, functional enzyme domains, and metabolic phenotypes. In both systems, residual in vitro activities correlated broadly with metabolic phenotypes, however, with significant discrepancies. Analysis of E. coli extracts by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and storage experiments showed that (i) in general, mutations in the N-terminal regulatory domain are associated with relatively stable proteins compared to most mutations in the central catalytic domain, and (ii) for mutations in the catalytic domain, high levels of protein aggregation do not always correspond with a severe phenotype.

Heterozygous germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS cause Costello syndrome, and its inheritance pattern would thus be autosomal dominant. With exception of two instances of parental mosaicism, one presumed gonadal and the other proven somatic mosaicism for the p.G12S change, all published cases resulted from de novo mutations, typically arising in the paternal germline.

We identified two additional individuals with this mutation, father and son. Further studies supported origin of the alteration in the grand-paternal germline. Transmission of the mutation underscores its attenuated phenotype compatible with reproduction. We reviewed the phenotype in the newly identified individuals (Patient 1, 2) and include updated information on the first previously reported individual with HRAS p.T58I (Patient 3). Macrocephaly was present in all three. Cardiac findings included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with double-chambered right ventricle; or mitral valve prolapse in one patient each.

Four of 48 children with slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss were homozygous for the GJB2 V37I change. The four children with homozygous V37I mutations were all of Asian background and analysis of SNPs in or near the GJB2 gene suggests that the V37I mutation arose from a single mutational event in the Asian population.
Based on the prevalence of carriers of this change we conclude that V37I can be a causative mutation that is often associated with slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss. No other children in the slight/mild hearing loss group had a hearing loss related to a GJB2 mutation. One child with normal hearing was homozygous for the R127H change and we conclude that this change does not cause hearing loss. Two children of Asian background were carriers of the V37I mutation.

23584145,"SHP2/PTPN11 is a key regulator of cytokine, growth factor and integrin signaling. SHP2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. Mutations in PTPN11 cause severe diseases like Noonan, LEOPARD syndrome or leukemia. Whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. In this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related SHP2-mutants bearing point mutations within the SH2-domain (T42A, E139D, and R138Q). Mutants were chosen according to SPR assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated SH2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. To analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (SILAC). Using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the SH2-domain of SHP2. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the SH2-domain. Mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of SHP2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. Thus, disease-associated mutants of SHP2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the SHP2 mutants.
Using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in SHP2 domains of SHP2 are able to influence SHP2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. We discovered that mutations in the SH2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the SH2-domain. We demonstrated that mutations within SHP2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of SHP2), also differ in respect to binding properties. Our study indicates that SHP2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the SHP2 mutants.

The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 171.5 kD and possesses laminin epidermal growth factor as well as fibronectin type III domains. These domains are observed in other protein components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes; they may also be observed in cell-adhesion molecules. The intron/exon organization of the gene whose protein we name ""Usherin"" was determined by direct sequencing of PCR products and cloned genomic DNA with cDNA-specific primers. The gene is encoded by 21 exons and spans a minimum of 105 kb. A mutation search of 57 independent USHIIa probands was performed with a combination of direct sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of PCR-amplified exons. Fifteen new mutations were found. Of 114 independent USH2A alleles, 58 harbored probable pathologic mutations. Ten cases of USHIIa were true homozygotes and 10 were compound heterozygotes; 18 heterozygotes with only one identifiable mutation were observed.

28892148,"Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (SKS) OMIM #616638, also known as MINDS syndrome (ORPHA 457485), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder reported so far in 23 patients. SKS is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly/hemi/megalencephaly, and seizures. It is also associated with a pattern of facial dysmorphology and other non-neurological features. Germline or mosaic mutations of the mTOR gene have been detected in all patients. The mTOR gene is a key regulator of cell growth, cell proliferation, protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, and the mTOR pathway (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) is highly regulated and critical for cell survival and apoptosis. Mutations in different genes in this pathway result in known rare diseases implicated in hemi/megalencephaly with epilepsy, as the tuberous sclerosis complex caused by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, or the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). We here present 4 new cases of SKS, review all clinical and molecular aspects of this disorder, as well as some characteristics of the patients with only brain mTOR somatic mutations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
24759143,"Factor XI (fXI) is the zymogen of a plasma protease, factor XIa (fXIa), that contributes to thrombin generation during blood coagulation by proteolytic conversion of factor IX (fIX) to factor IXaβ (fIXaβ). There is considerable interest in fXIa as a therapeutic target because it contributes to thrombosis, while serving a relatively minor role in hemostasis. FXI/XIa has a distinctly different structure than other plasma coagulation proteases. Specifically, the protein lacks a phospholipid-binding Gla-domain, and is a homodimer. Each subunit of a fXIa dimer contains four apple domains (A1 to A4) and one trypsin-like catalytic domain. The A3 domain contains a binding site (exosite) that largely determines affinity and specificity for the substrate fIX. After binding to fXIa, fIX undergoes a single cleavage to form the intermediate fIXα. FIXα then rebinds to the A3 domain to undergo a second cleavage, generating fIXaβ. The catalytic efficiency for the second cleavage is ~7-fold greater than that of the first cleavage, limiting fIXα accumulation. Residues at the N-terminus and C-terminus of the fXIa A3 domain likely form the fIX binding site. The dimeric conformation of fXIa is not required for normal fIX activation in solution. However, monomeric forms of fXI do not reconstitute fXI-deficient mice in arterial thrombosis models, indicating the dimer is required for normal function in vivo. FXI must be a dimer to be activated normal by the protease fXIIa. It is also possible that the dimeric structure is an adaptation that allows fXI/XIa to bind to a surface through one subunit, while binding to its substrate fIX through the other.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
22285650,"Patients with PS or non-syndromic deafness were submitted to genetic/functional analyzes of SLC26A4, of its binding domain for FOXI1 (FOXI1-DBD), of the transcription activator FOXI1, and of the potassium channel KCNJ10. SLC26A4 was the most frequently mutated gene. An altered intracellular localization with immunocytochemistry, and a hampered maturation process were demonstrated for two novel SLC26A4 variants. Biochemical and immunocytochemical analyzes led to the development of a more sensitive fluorometric functional assay able to reveal the partial loss-of-function of SLC26A4 mutations. A novel missense variant was found in FOXI1 gene, though functional analysis showed no significant impairment in the transcriptional activation of SLC26A4. Finally, 3 patients were found to harbor a variant in KCNJ10, which was classified as polymorphism. The novelty of the study resides in the analysis of all the 4 candidate genetic loci linked to PS/non-syndromic deafness, and in the precise definition of the thyroid phenotype. PS was invariably associated with biallelic mutations of SLC26A4, whereas the genetic origin of non-syndromic deafness remained largely undetermined, since monoallelic SLC26A4 variants accounted for one fourth of the cases and FOXI1 and KCNJ10 were not involved in this series.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
23885229,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, short stature and congenital heart defects. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous and shows clinical overlap with other RASopathies. These syndromes are caused by mutations in a variety of genes leading to dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway: PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, RAF1, CBL, SHOC2, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, HRAS, NF1 and SPRED1. In this study, we conduct a genotype-phenotype analysis of 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of NS without a PTPN11 mutation. Mutation analysis of the genes involved in RASopathies was performed, except for NF1 and SPRED1. In 14 (42%) NS patients, a mutation was found, 7 (21%) had a mutation in SOS1, 3 (9%) in RAF1 and 1 (3%) in KRAS, MAP2K2, BRAF and SHOC2 each. The phenotype of these mutation-positive cases corresponded to that described in the literature. In the cases with a BRAF and MAP2K2 mutation, the diagnosis cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome was made. The patient with the SHOC2 mutation had features compatible with 'Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair'. Three major clinical features of NS - a typical face, short stature and a pulmonary valve stenosis - were less frequently present in the group without a mutation. Missense mutations in genes encoding proteins of the RAS-MAPK pathway cause NS. The 3 major clinical features of NS were less frequently present in the mutation-negative patients, which stresses the importance of the syndrome-specific symptoms of the face, heart and short stature in NS. However, all mutation-negative cases met the NS criteria, indicating that the involvement of novel genes is to be expected.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Cross-sectional clinical genetic study.
Tertiary care outpatient otolaryngology clinic.
A total of 32 subjects identified with bilateral EVA using high-resolution CT were screened for mutations in SLC26A4 by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing methods.
A total of 13 different mutations were identified in the SLC26A4 gene, five of which are novel. A total of 88 percent of the patients harbored biallelic mutations, 11 patients were homozygotes, and 17 were compound heterozygotes. Four patients were found to carry a single SLC26A4 mutation. The IVS7-2A>G mutation was the most frequent, accounting for 60 percent of the mutant alleles. We have not found any correlations between the type of SLC26A4 mutations and the type, degree, and progression of hearing loss. There are significant proportions of patients with asymmetric (26%), progressive (32%), or fluctuating hearing loss (21%).
Our data confirm the high prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations in Chinese patients with SNHL and EVA. We could not establish any relationship between genotype and phenotype. However, the high incidence of asymmetric, progressive, and fluctuating hearing loss found in the current study indicates that patients with those features should be routinely screened for SLC26A4 mutation in addition to diagnosis of EVA using CT or MRI.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Fifty-five families affected by LGMD were recruited using an institutionally approved protocol. Exome sequencing was performed on probands and selected parental samples. Pathogenic mutations and cosegregation patterns were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Twenty-two families (40%) had novel and previously reported pathogenic mutations, primarily in LGMD genes, and also in genes for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, myofibrillar myopathy, inclusion body myopathy and Pompe disease. One family was diagnosed via clinical testing. Dominant mutations were identified in COL6A1, COL6A3, FLNC, LMNA, RYR1, SMCHD1 and VCP, recessive mutations in ANO5, CAPN3, GAA, LAMA2, SGCA and SGCG, and X-linked mutations in DMD. A previously reported variant in DMD was confirmed to be benign. Exome sequencing is a powerful diagnostic tool for LGMD. Despite careful phenotypic screening, pathogenic mutations were found in other muscle disease genes, largely accounting for the increased sensitivity of exome sequencing. Our experience suggests that broad sequencing panels are useful for these analyses because of the phenotypic overlap of many neuromuscular conditions. The confirmation of a benign DMD variant illustrates the potential of exome sequencing to help determine pathogenicity.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
9766574,"p53 is very often mutated in human cancers. The majority of alterations are missense mutations located within the DNA-binding domain of the protein. Many reports have characterized such mutant proteins. Little is known, however, about the properties of proteins that have a missense mutation outside this domain. We investigated here the properties of 8 mutant proteins identified in human tumors as having a missense mutation in the tetramerization domain. The Arg342Gln, Glu349Asp and Gln354Arg proteins behaved like wild-type both in vitro and in cells. Two mutants, Arg342Pro and Leu344Pro, were inactive in all assays. Finally, the 3 mutant proteins Leu330His, Arg337Cys and Arg337Leu, which are inactive in vitro, showed no activity at low expression levels in cells but became active at higher expression levels.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of LGMD2A, we constructed nine p94 missense point mutants found in LGMD2A and analyzed their p94 unique properties. All mutants completely or almost completely lose the proteolytic activity against a potential substrate, fodrin. However, some of the mutants still possess autolytic activity and/or connectin/titin binding ability, indicating these properties are not necessary for the LGMD2A phenotypes. These results provide strong evidence that LGMD2A results from the loss of proteolysis of substrates by p94, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism leading to muscular dystrophies.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

For each such gene, however, previous studies have reported a range of different mutation frequencies, and clinical manifestations have been highly heterogeneous, both of which limit the use of genetic information in clinical practice. Our aim was to determine the frequency of mutations in the sarcomeric genes MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, and TPM1 in a cohort of Spanish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
We used sequencing to analyze the coding regions of these five genes in 120 patients (29% with a family history) and investigated how the patient phenotype varied with the gene mutated.
In total, 32 patients were found to have mutations: 10 in MYH7 (8%), 20 in MYBPC3 (16%), 2 in TNNT2, 1 in TPM1 and none in TNNI3. Overall, 61% of mutations had not been described before. Two patients had two mutations (i.e., double mutants). There was no difference in the mean age at diagnosis or the extent of the hypertrophy between those with MYH7 mutations and those with MYBPC3 mutations.
Some 26% of patients had a mutation in one of the five sarcomeric genes investigated. More than half of the mutations had not been described before. The MYBPC3 gene was the most frequently mutated, followed by MYH7. No phenotypic differences were observed between carriers of the various mutations, which makes it difficult to use genetic information to stratify risk in these patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is an allelic disorder characterised by macrocephaly, intestinal polyps, lipomas, and pigmented penile macules. Diagnostic criteria for CS are based on the presence of a range of clinical features. However, prior data on the component clinical features have been based primarily on compilations of cases reported before development of consensus diagnostic criteria.
This study sought to determine the clinical features most predictive of a mutation in the largest single cohort of patients with clinical testing for PTEN mutations reported to date.
Molecular and clinical data were reviewed on 802 patients referred for PTEN analysis by a single laboratory.
Deleterious mutations were found in 172 (21.4%) subjects. Among mutation carriers significant differences from previous reports were found for the frequencies of several clinical features, including macrocephaly, uterine fibroids, benign breast disease, and endometrial cancer. Logistic regression analyses indicated that female mutation carriers were best identified by the presence of macrocephaly, endometrial cancer, trichilemmomas, papillomatous papules, breast cancer, benign thyroid disease, and benign gastrointestinal (GI) lesions. For males, the most discriminating features were macrocephaly, lipomas, papillomatous papules, penile freckling, benign GI lesions, and benign thyroid disease. Age related differences were also identified.
The mutation frequency in patients meeting CS diagnostic criteria (34%) was significantly lower than previously reported, suggesting a need for reevaluation of these criteria.

17661820,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a congenital abnormality that affects multiple parts of the body. Approximately 50% of cases are caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene. NS shares many clinical features with a group of developmental disorders including Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Recently, KRAS and SOS1 were identified as causative genes for NS. Moreover, mutations in several genes associated with the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including HRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 were identified in patients with Costello syndrome and CFC syndrome. Accordingly, this study carried out mutation analysis of nine genes including PTPN11, SOS1, GRB2, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 associated with the Ras-MAPK pathway in 14 Korean patients with NS. Seven patients were found to have mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Mutation analyses of the other genes did not reveal any disease causing mutations except for one unclassified variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the HRAS gene (c.*1C>T). The patient's father also had the same substitution with the normal phenotype. Therefore, this variation is believed to be either a rare polymorphism or a disease-related variation with variable penetrance. The Ras-MAPK pathway has now emerged as a key cascade in a group of similar developmental disorders as well as in many types of cancers. This study found that, with the exception of PTPN11, mutations in genes related to the Ras-MAPK pathway appear to be uncommon, at least in Korean patients with NS.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

The human myosin VIIA gene, located on 11q14, has been shown to be responsible for Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B). Haplotypes were constructed in 28 USH1 families by use of the following polymorphic markers spanning the USH1B locus: D11S787, D11S527, D11S1789, D11S906, D11S4186, and OMP. Affected individuals and members of their families from 12 different ethnic origins were screened for the presence of mutations in all 49 exons of the myosin VIIA gene. In 15 families myosin VIIA mutations were detected, verifying their classification as USH1B. All these mutations are novel, including three missense mutations, one premature stop codon, two splicing mutations, one frameshift, and one deletion of >2 kb comprising exons 47 and 48, a part of exon 49, and the introns between them. Three mutations were shared by more than one family, consistent with haplotype similarities. Altogether, 16 USH1B haplotypes were observed in the 15 families; most haplotypes were population specific. Several exonic and intronic polymorphisms were also detected.

Previous studies have identified 40 mutations accounting for the majority (98%) of mutant alleles underlying PAH deficiency in Sicily. In order to study the molecular basis of the distribution of PAH deficiency phenotypes in the Sicilian population, we have correlated 31 of those mutations with clinical and metabolic phenotypes in 12 mentally retarded patients, 14 treated patients with classic or mild PKU, and 13 subjects presenting the non-PKU HPA phenotype.

Yet, prevalence of the involvement of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in patients with megalencephaly remains to be elucidated, and molecular diagnosis is challenging. Here, we have successfully established a combination of genetic and biochemical methods for diagnosis of mTOR pathway-associated megalencephaly, and have attempted to delineate the clinical characteristics of the disorder.
Thirteen patients with an increased head circumference and neurological symptoms participated in the study. To evaluate the activation of the mTOR pathway, we performed western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (phospho-S6 protein) in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 12 patients. Multiplex targeted sequencing analysis for 15 genes involved in the mTOR pathway was performed on 12 patients, and whole-exome sequencing was performed on one additional patient. Clinical features and MRI findings were also investigated.
We identified pathogenic mutations in six (AKT3, 1 patient; PIK3R2, 2 patients; PTEN, 3 patients) of the 13 patients. Increased expression of phospho-S6 protein was demonstrated in all five mutation-positive patients in whom western blotting was performed, as well as in three mutation-negative patients. Developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features were observed in almost all patients. Syndactyly/polydactyly and capillary malformations were not observed, even in patients with AKT3 or PIK3R2 mutations. There were no common phenotypes or MRI findings among these patients.
A combination of genetic and biochemical methods successfully identified mTOR pathway involvement in nine of 13 (approximately 70%) patients with megalencephaly, indicating a major contribution of the pathway to the pathogenesis of megalencephaly.

In this work, we have performed the molecular characterization of 105 HPA patients from Galicia, in the northwest region of Spain, evaluating their phenotype and BH4 response. The mutational spectrum analysis showed 47 distinct mutations in 89 families, 37 of them (78.7%) corresponding to missense mutations. Six mutations account for 47.2% of all the investigated alleles, each one with a frequency ≥ 5% (IVS10-11G>A, p.R261Q, p.V388M, p.R176L, p.E280K, p.A300S). The most prevalent HPA mutations in Galicia are the common Mediterranean mutation IVS10-11G>A and p.R261Q, with frequencies of 13.8% and 10.5%, respectively. One novel mutation (p.K361Q; c.1081A>C) was also reported. Although a good genotype-phenotype correlation is observed, there is no exact correlation for some genotypes involving mutations p.R261Q, p.I65T or IVS10-11G>A. Forty seven patients were monitored for post-challenge BH4, establishing genotype-based predictions of BH4-responsiveness in all of them. All phenylketonuric patients with 2 nonresponsive mutations were unresponsive to BH4 and patients with mutations previously associated with BH4 responsiveness in the two alleles had a clear positive response to the test, with the exception of 5 patients with mutations p.R261Q, p.I65T and p.R68S.

27517496,"Numerous mutations of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene have been reported to cause dysfunction of VHL protein (pVHL) and lead to processes related to tumor progression. pVHL acts as an E3 ligase and degrades downstream targets, such as hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) which is essential for tumor growth. Previous studies reported reduction of VHL protein, rather than mRNA in VHL-related tumor patients, suggesting that instability of the pVHL protein itself is a primary cause of dysfunction. Regulation of pVHL stability has therefore been a major focus of research. We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X), which is a deubiquitinase binds and promotes degradation of both wild-type and mutants of pVHL that retain E3 ligase function, thus activating the HIF pathway. USP9X degrades pVHL through protection of its substrate, the newly identified pVHL E3 ligase Smurf1. In addition, USP9X activates glycolysis and promotes cell proliferation through pVHL. Treatment with a USP9X inhibitor shows an effect similar to USP9X knockdown in pVHL induction, and suppresses HIF activity. Our findings demonstrate that USP9X is a novel regulator of pVHL stability, and USP9X may be a therapeutic target for treatment of VHL-related tumors.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The CDH1 missense mutations described to date span the entire gene and some lead to significant functional consequences. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that mutations affecting different E-cadherin protein domains have distinct effects on cell motility.

Further, we studied their effect on the activation of signalling pathways known to be relevant for cell motility such as the EGFR, Src kinase and MAPKs. CDH1 mutations localized on the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains, both affecting the integrity of the extracellular domain, led to increased cell motility accompanied by increased EGFR activation. Moreover, we observed that cells expressing extracellular mutants exhibit increased activation of Src kinase and p38 MAPK. Our results allowed the identification of the E-cadherin domains pivotal for cell motility, further demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation, and defined a subset of HDGC cases which may benefit from EGFR inhibitors.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

A number of patients have been previously tested for their response to dietary supplementation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of PAH. Correlation between genotype and the responses revealed that although genotype is a major determinant of BH4 responsiveness, patients with the same genotype may also show disparate responses to this treatment. A clinical and biochemical evaluation should be undertaken to determine the effectiveness of PKU treatment by supplementation of BH4.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
25991456,"Aetiological assessment of 71 probands whose clinical presentation suggested a genetic syndrome or auditory neuropathy.
Sanger sequencing was performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines. Genes were selected for sequencing based on each patient's clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis. Observed DNA sequence variations were assessed for pathogenicity by review of the scientific literature, and mutation and polymorphism databases, through the use of in silico tools including sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) and polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen), and according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for the interpretation of DNA sequence variations. Novel DNA sequence variations were sought in controls.
DNA sequencing of the coding and near-coding regions of genes relevant to each patient's clinical presentation revealed 37 sequence variations of known or uncertain pathogenicity in 9 genes from 25 patients. 14 novel sequence variations were discovered. Assessment of phenotypes revealed notable findings in 9 patients.
DNA sequencing in patients whose clinical presentation suggested a genetic syndrome or auditory neuropathy provided opportunities for aetiological assessment and more precise genetic counselling of patients and families. The failure to identify a genetic aetiology in many patients in this study highlights the extreme heterogeneity of genetic hearing loss, the incompleteness of current knowledge of aetiologies of hearing loss, and the limitations of conventional DNA sequencing strategies that evaluate only coding and near-coding segments of genes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

The profile of explicit long term memory abilities was investigated using PROMEA, which includes a battery of tests specifically developed to assess memory and learning in verbal, visual and spatial domains. Ten individuals (50%) had impaired (≤5th percentile) or below average (≤15th percentile) performance on a delayed verbal free recall memory task, four (20%) on a delayed visual recognition memory task, and only one (5%) on a delayed spatial recognition memory task.

This not only obfuscates personalized health care but also the development of a rapid and reliable classification procedure that does not require clinical data.
The complete in vitro MMR activity (CIMRA) assay was calibrated against clinically classified MSH6 variants and, employing Bayes' rule, integrated with computational predictions of pathogenicity. To enable the validation of this two-component classification procedure we have employed a genetic screen to generate a large set of inactivating Msh6 variants, as proxies for pathogenic variants.
The genetic screen-derived variants established that the two-component classification procedure displays high sensitivities and specificities. Moreover, these inactivating variants enabled the direct reclassification of human variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as (likely) pathogenic.
The two-component classification procedure and the genetic screens provide complementary approaches to rapidly and cost-effectively classify the large majority of human MSH6 variants. The approach followed here provides a template for the classification of variants in other disease-predisposing genes, facilitating the translation of personalized genomics into personalized health care.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

It was confirmed that GJB2 mutations are an important cause of hearing loss in this population, with three mutations, 235delC, Y136X, and R143W, especially frequent. Of these three mutations, 235delC was most prevalent at 73%. Surprisingly, the 35delG mutation, which is the most common GJB2 mutation in white subjects, was not found in the present study.

Four of these mutations (T238P: ACT-->CCT; L242F:CTC-->TTC; R252G:CGG-->GGG; and 1043 delta 11: nt 1043-nt 1053 deleted) have so far not been described in the literature. Including these new mutations at least 21 different gene lesions and one sequence polymorphism exist for exon 7. Despite this large number unbiased calculation of the mutation frequency/exon size ratio does not provide conclusive evidence that exon 7 is a hot spot for disease causing mutations. Extensive screening during our experiments also failed to demonstrate the existence of excessive polymorphism in this part of the gene. It might therefore be speculated that the functional importance of the highly conserved exon 7 sequence accounts for the clustering of observed mutations which result in clinically manifest PKU. In addition we report our experience in regard to the resolution capacity of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), a nonradioactive technique for the rapid screening of unknown mutations in exon 7.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Prevalence of COCH mutations worldwide is unknown, as there is no systematic screening effort for late-onset hearing disorders; however, to date, COCH mutations have been found on four continents and the possibility of COCH playing an important role in presbycusis and disorders of imbalance has been considered. Cochlin (encoded by COCH) has also been shown as a major target antigen for autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. In this report, we present histopathology, immunohistochemistry and proteomic analyses of inner ear tissues from post-mortem DFNA9 temporal bone samples of an individual from a large Dutch kindred segregating the P51S mutation and adult human unaffected controls, and wild-type (+/+) and Coch null (-/-) knock-out mice. DFNA9 is an inner ear disorder with a unique histopathology showing loss of cellularity and aggregation of abundant homogeneous acellular eosinophilic deposits in the cochlear and vestibular labyrinths, similar to protein aggregation in well-known neurodegenerative disorders. By immunohistochemistry on the DFNA9 temporal bone sections, we have shown cochlin staining of the characteristic cochlear and vestibular deposits, indicating aggregation of cochlin in the same structures in which it is normally expressed. Proteomic analysis identified cochlin as the most abundant protein in mouse and human cochleae. The high-level expression and stability of cochlin in the inner ear, even in the absence and severe atrophy of the fibrocytes that normally express COCH, are shown through these studies and further elucidate the pathobiologic events occurring in DFNA9 leading to hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Biochemical studies indicated VLCAD deficiency caused by a stable yet inactive enzyme. Molecular genetic analysis of her VLCAD gene revealed a T1372C (F458L) missense mutation and a 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation. After initial treatment with intravenous glucose and carnitine, the patient has thrived on a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride oil and carnitine and avoidance of fasting.

11142755,"We describe a simple and technically feasible method for mutation screening of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and its application to Japanese and Chinese patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. The strategy is based on the identification of a nucleotide substitution by restriction enzyme analysis, coupled with PCR and direct sequencing of exon 7 of the PAH gene. Because the detection of various mutations can proceed simultaneously using the same technique, it is quite rapid and reproducible, making it possible to perform effective molecular diagnosis and carrier screening in most laboratories. Using this procedure, we found that the most common molecular defects were R413P in Hokkaido, Japan (35 %) and R243Q in Heilongjiang, China (50%). R111X, IVS4nt-1, and five mutations in exon 7 (R241C, R243Q, R252W, A259T, and S273P) accounted for 55% of phenylketonuria (PKU) alleles in Hokkaido. In Heilongjiang, the R111X, Y356X, and R408W mutations accounted for 35% of PKU alleles. Clinically, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes of null alleles, which express nonfunctional enzyme activity, were all associated with classic PKU. On the other hand, patients heterozygous for the R241C allele had a benign phenotype of mild hyperphenylalaninemia.

The authors aimed to investigate the mutation spectrums of these genes in Chinese patients with bilateral hearing impairment associated with inner ear malformation.
Cross-sectional study.
Affiliated hospital of the university.
The authors analyzed the GJB2, SLC26A4, FOXI1, and KCNJ10 gene sequences in 43 patients presenting with bilateral hearing impairment associated with inner ear malformation using pyrosequencing and direct DNA sequencing.
In total, 74.4% (32/43) of patients carried at least 1 of 14 pathogenic SLC26A4 mutations, including 6 novel mutations and 4 polymorphisms. Patients with enlarged vestibular aqueducts had a higher rate of SLC26A4 mutation than Mondini dysplasia patients. No FOXI1 or KCNJ10 potential pathogenic mutation was present, and GJB2 biallelic pathogenic mutations were uncommon (2.3%; 1/43). No significant correlation was observed between the genotype and phenotype of SLC26A4 mutations.

17700531,"Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene predisposes to vascular tumor formation in several organs. VHL regulates two evolutionary conserved pathways: the targeting of hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) for proteasomal degradation and the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). The biochemical mechanisms of the ECM assembly pathway remain poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence supporting a biochemical role for VHL in ECM assembly. We show that VHL directly binds to the collagen IV alpha 2 (COL4A2) chain and that this interaction is necessary for its assembly into the ECM. The VHL-COL4A2 interaction is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated COL4A2 hydroxylation and independent of cytosolic, hypoxia regulated HIF-alpha-modifying enzymes. We find that the N-terminal tail of COL4A2 protrudes from the ER lumen into the cytosol where it is bound by VHL. Failure of VHL to interact with COL4A2 correlates with loss of collagen IV network formation in vitro and collagen IV remodeling in vivo. Our data suggest a HIF-alpha-independent role for the VHL-COL4A2 interaction in suppression of angiogenic tumor formation through collagen IV network assembly.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
11054083,"We report here the genetic basis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome in a compound heterozygote for two mutant glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha alleles. One allele contained a novel four base-pair deletion (TGAG) that eliminated the last base of the codon for Ser39 (AGT) and the entire codon for Glu40 (GAG), causing a reading frame shift that yielded a stretch of 51 amino acids before a premature stop codon. The other allele also contained a frame-shift mutation, caused by deletion of the last two bases of the codon for Tyr492 (TAT). This allele produced a truncated glycoprotein Ib alpha that, although not expressed on the surface of the patient's platelets, was detectable in the plasma. The second allele has been identified previously by our group and other investigators as the cause of Bernard-Soulier syndrome in patients of northern European ancestry. This allele carried a haplotype identical to those of the previously reported cases, with the following polymorphic markers: two tandem repeats in the VNTR region, C at nucleotide -5 from the ATG start codon and a substitution of G for A in the third base for codon Arg342. These findings suggest that this particular Bernard-Soulier mutation occurred once on the background of a rare haplotype and has spread throughout the northern European population.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

By studying mutation carriers before a clinical diagnosis develops, we characterize the early manifestations of sarcomere mutations in DCM and investigate how these manifestations differ from sarcomere mutations associated with HCM.
Sixty-two genotyped individuals in families with sarcomeric DCM underwent clinical evaluation including strain echocardiography. The group included 12 subclinical DCM mutation carriers with normal cardiac dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥55%), 21 overt DCM subjects, and 29 related mutation (-) normal controls. Results were compared with a previously characterized cohort of 60 subclinical HCM subjects (sarcomere mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy). Systolic myocardial tissue velocity, longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain, and longitudinal and radial strain rate were reduced by 10%-23% in subclinical DCM mutation carriers compared with controls (P<0.001 for all comparisons), after adjusting for age and family relations. No significant differences in diastolic parameters were identified comparing the subclinical and control cohorts. The opposite pattern of contractile abnormalities with reduced diastolic but preserved systolic function was seen in subclinical HCM.
Subtle abnormalities in systolic function are present in subclinical DCM mutation carriers, despite normal left ventricular size and ejection fraction. In contrast, impaired relaxation and preserved systolic function appear to be the predominant early manifestations of sarcomere mutations that lead to HCM. These findings support the theory that the mutation's intrinsic impact on sarcomere function influences whether a dilated or hypertrophic phenotype develops.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing of the entire coding region 5 mutations were detected in diffuse-type gastric cancer specimens. The sequence alterations include 3 missense mutations affecting exons 3, 10, and 12. Furthermore, two in-frame deletions were identified removing 63 and 9 base pairs from exon 4 and 5, respectively. In invasive Lobular breast cancer 6 E-cadherin mutations were detected after RT-PCR amplification and direct sequencing or using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by sequencing. In addition to two nonsense mutations affecting exon 2, four out-of-frame deletions removing 115 base pairs (entire exon 2), 224 base pairs (entire exon 3), 8 base pairs from exon 12 or 1 base pair from exon 13 were seen.

The full set of chromosomes harboured 45 different PAH mutations: i) seven polymorphisms (IVS2nt19, IVS3nt-22, IVS6nt-55, Q232Q, V245V, L385L, Y414Y); ii) four mutations causing non-PKU HPA (T92I, E390G, R408Q, D415N); iii) 34 mutations causing PKU. Only six mutations (M1V, R261Q, F299C, S349P, R408W and IVS12nt1) occurred in the whole province at relative frequencies > 5%: most are rare and probably identical by descent. By studying associations of mutations with polymorphic haplotype alleles, we found examples of mutations on different haplotypes that were identical by state, but not by descent because they were recurrent mutations (E280K and R408W); and examples of mutations identical both by state and by descent because of intragenic recombination (S67P, G218V, V245A and IVS12nt1). Ten mutations were first described in Quebec and five are still unique there; three of these 'Quebec' mutations are reported here for the first time (c.125A-->T (K42I); [c.470G-->A; c.471A--C] (R157N); c.707nt-55 (IVS6nt-55). The PAH mutations stratify by geographic region and population, their distributions validating hypotheses about European range expansion to North America during three separate phases of immigration and demographic expansion in the Quebec region over the past four centuries. The PAH homozygosity value (j) is 0.06 for the total Quebec sample (0.5-0.08 by regions), and the corresponding homoallelic fraction of mutant PAH genotypes is 24%.

While blood Phe in the 8 nonresponders did not change significantly throughout the study, their Tyr levels were significantly higher at 6 months (p=0.012), but not at 12 months (p=0.23). By the end of the study, 8 subjects exhibited fewer maladaptive behaviors on the components of the Vineland Maladaptive Behavior Index, and all 10 had lower total scores on the PKU Behavior Checklist.

Point mutations in the PAH gene are known to cause PKU in various ethnic groups, and large deletions or duplications account for up to 3% of the PAH mutations in some ethnic groups. However, a previous study could not identify approximately 14% of the mutant alleles by sequence analysis in Korean patients with PKU, which suggests that large deletions or duplication might be frequent causes of PKU in Koreans. To test this hypothesis, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the identification of uncharacterized mutant alleles after PAH sequence analysis of 33 unrelated Korean patients with PKU. Bi-directional sequencing of the PAH exons and flanking intronic regions revealed 27 different mutations, including four novel mutations (two missense and two deletion mutations), comprising 57/66 (86%) mutant alleles. MLPA identified a large deletion that encompassed exons 5 and 6 in four patients, another large deletion that extended from exon 4 to exon 7 in one patient, and a duplication of exon 4 in one patient. Chromosomal walking characterized the deletion breakpoint of the most common large deletion that involved exons 5 and 6 (c.456_706+138del).

Mutation analyses of RUNX1 in 3 families with FPD/AML showing linkage to chromosome 21q22.1 revealed 3 novel heterozygous point mutations (K83E, R135fsX177 (IVS4 + 3delA), and Y260X). Functional investigations of the 7 FPD/AML RUNX1 Runt domain point mutations described to date (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed. Consistent with the position of the mutations in the Runt domain at the RUNX1-DNA interface, DNA binding of all mutant RUNX1 proteins was absent or significantly decreased. In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1. Colocalization of mutant RUNX1 and PEBP2beta/CBFbeta in the cytoplasm was observed. These results suggest that the sequestration of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta by mutant RUNX1 may cause the inhibitory effects. While haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes FPD/AML in some families (deletions and frameshifts), mutant RUNX1 proteins (missense and nonsense) may also inhibit wild-type RUNX1, possibly creating a higher propensity to develop leukemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur, either in RUNX1 or another gene, to cause leukemia among individuals harboring RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations and that the propensity to acquire these additional mutations is determined, at least partially, by the initial RUNX1 mutation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In this study we investigated 150 LGMD patients with normal calpain-3 protein expression, identified gene mutations by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction test, and analyzed the mutant calpain-3 catalytic activity. Four different mutations were found in eight patients (5.5%): a frame-shifting deletion (550 A del) and three missense (R490Q, R489Q, R490W). Patients with normal calpain-3 protein expression on Western blot are a considerable proportion (20%) of our total LGMD2A population. While in control muscle the calpain-3 Ca(++)-dependent autocatalytic activity was evident within 5 minutes and was prevented by ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid, in all mutant patient samples the protein was not degraded, indicating that the normal autocatalytic function had been lost. By this new functional test, we show that conventional protein diagnosis fails to detect some mutant proteins, and prove the pathogenetic role of R490Q, R489Q, R490W missense mutations.

Participant groups had similar distributions of gender (48% vs. 45% males in Usher syndrome type IIa vs. nonsydromic RP; P = 0.8), ethnicity (97% vs. 99% European; P = 0.3), and median follow-up time (6.5 years vs. 3 years; P = 0.3). Usher syndrome type IIa patients demonstrated symptoms at a younger age (median age, 15 years vs. 25 years; P < 0.001), were diagnosed earlier (median age, 26 years vs. 36.5 years; P < 0.001), and became visually impaired 13 years earlier (median age, 41 years vs. 54 years; P < 0.001) based on VF and 18 years earlier based on VA (median age, 54 years vs. 72 years; P < 0.001) than nonsyndromic RP patients. The presence of 2 truncating mutations in USH2A was associated mostly with the syndromic phenotype, whereas other combinations were present in both groups. We found novel variants in Usher syndrome type IIa (25%) and nonsyndromic RP (19%): 29 missense mutations, 10 indels, 14 nonsense mutations, 9 frameshift mutations, and 5 splice-site mutations.
Most patients with USH2A-associated RP have severe visual impairment by age 50. However, those with Usher syndrome type IIa have an earlier decline of visual function and a higher cumulative risk of visual impairment than those without nonsyndromic RP. Complete loss of function of the USH2A protein predisposes to Usher syndrome type IIa, but remnant protein function can lead to RP with or without hearing loss.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
16267253,"Nonobstructive hypertrophy localized to the cardiac apex is an uncommon morphological variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that often is further distinguished by distinct giant negative T waves and a benign clinical course. The genetic relationship between HCM with typical hypertrophic morphology versus isolated apical hypertrophy is incompletely understood.
Genetic cause was investigated in 15 probands with apical hypertrophy by DNA sequence analyses of 9 sarcomere protein genes and 3 other genes (GLA, PRKAG2, and LAMP2) implicated in idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy. Six sarcomere gene mutations were found in 7 samples; no samples contained mutations in GLA, PRKAG2, or LAMP2. Clinical evaluations demonstrated familial apical HCM in 4 probands, and in 3 probands disease-causing mutations were identified. Two families shared a cardiac actin Glu101Lys missense mutation; all members of both families with clinical manifestations of HCM (n=16) had apical hypertrophy. An essential light chain missense mutation Met149Val caused apical or midventricular segment HCM in another proband and 5 family members, but 6 other affected relatives had typical HCM morphologies. No other sarcomere gene mutations identified in the remaining probands caused apical HCM in other family members.
Sarcomere protein gene mutations that cause apical hypertrophy rather than more common HCM morphologies reflect interactions among genetic etiology, background modifier genes, and/or hemodynamic factors. Only a limited number of sarcomere gene defects (eg, cardiac actin Glu101Lys) consistently produce apical HCM.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Platelet phenotypes and allelic variations in 28 Turkish GT patients are reported. Platelets αIIbβ3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Sequence analyzes ofITGA2BandITGB3genes allowed identifying nine variants. Non-sense variation effect on αIIbβ3 expression was studied by using transfected cell lines. 3D molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations allowed characterizing structural alterations. Five new alleles were described. αIIb:p.Gly423Asp, p.Asp560Ala and p.Tyr784Cys substitutions impaired αIIbβ3 expression. The αIIb:p.Gly128Val substitution allowed normal expression; however, the corresponding NM_000419.3:c.476G>T variation would create a cryptic donor splicing site altering mRNA processing. The β3:p.Gly540Asp substitution allowed αIIbβ3 expression in HEK-293 cells but induced its constitutive activation likely by impairing αIIb and β3 legs interaction. The substitution alters the β3 I-EGF-3 domain flexibility as shown by MDs simulations. GT variations are mostly unique although the NM_000419.3:c.1752 + 2 T > C and NM_000212.2:c.1697 G > A variations identified in 4 and 8 families, respectively, might be a current cause of GT in Turkey.

Somatic variants in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulatory genes have been implicated in some HME cases; however, ∼70% have no identified genetic etiology. Here, we screened two HME patients to identify disease-causing somatic variants. DNA from leukocytes, buccal swabs, and surgically resected brain tissue from two HME patients were screened for somatic variants using genome-wide genotyping arrays or sequencing of the protein-coding regions of the genome. Functional studies were performed to evaluate the molecular consequences of candidate disease-causing variants. Both HME patients evaluated were found to have likely disease-causing variants in DNA extracted from brain tissue but not in buccal swab or leukocyte DNA, consistent with a somatic mutational mechanism. In the first case, a previously identified disease-causing somatic single nucleotide inMTORwas identified. In the second case, we detected an overrepresentation of the alleles inherited from the mother on Chromosome 16 in brain tissue DNA only, indicative of somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) of the p-arm of Chromosome 16. Using methylation analyses, an imprinted locus on 16p spanningZNF597was identified, which results in increased expression ofZNF597mRNA and protein in the brain tissue of the second case. Enhanced mTOR signaling was observed in tissue specimens from both patients. We speculate that overexpression of maternally expressedZNF597led to aberrant hemispheric development in the patient with somatic UPD of Chromosome 16p possibly through modulation of mTOR signaling.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Creatine deficiency on brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and elevated urinary creatine to creatinine ratio are important biomarkers. Mutations in the SLC6A8 gene occur de novo in 30% of males. Despite reports of high prevalence of CRTR-D in males with intellectual disability, there are no true prevalence studies in the general population. To determine carrier frequency of CRTR-D in the general population we studied the variants in the SLC6A8 gene reported in the Exome Variant Server database and performed functional characterization of missense variants. We also analyzed synonymous and intronic variants for their predicted pathogenicity using in silico analysis tools. Nine missense variants were functionally analyzed using transient transfection by site-directed mutagenesis with In-Fusion HD Cloning in HeLa cells. Creatine uptake was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for creatine measurement. The c.1654G>T (p.Val552Leu) variant showed low residual creatine uptake activity of 35% of wild type transfected HeLa cells and was classified as pathogenic. Three variants (c.808G>A; p.Val270Met, c.942C>G; p.Phe314Leu and c.952G>A; p.Ala318Thr) were predicted to be pathogenic based on in silico analysis, but proved to be non-pathogenic by our functional analysis. The estimated carrier frequency of CRTR-D was 0.024% in females in the general population.

Here, we have asked whether there are perturbations in precursor cell proliferation, differentiation, or survival as a consequence of expressing CS H-Ras alleles that could explain the cognitive deficits seen in this disorder. Two different H-Ras alleles encoding mutations present in CS patients, H-RasG12V and H-RasG12S were expressed in cortical progenitors in culture and in vivo by in utero electroporation and their effects on cortical precursor cell fate examined. Expression of both mutants in cultured precursors inhibited neurogenesis and promoted proliferation and astrogenesis. In vivo, expression of either form of CS H-Ras promoted cell proliferation and inhibited neurogenesis. Moreover, these H-Ras mutants promoted premature gliogenesis, causing formation of astrocytes at a time when normal gliogenesis has not yet begun, ultimately leading to an increase in the number of astrocytes postnatally. Thus, aberrant H-Ras activation enhances neural precursor cell proliferation, and perturbs the normal genesis of neurons and glial cells, effects that likely contribute to the cortical abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction seen in CS.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

20978130,"The tumor suppressor p53, a 393-amino acid transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Its inactivation via the mutation of its gene is a key step in tumor progression, and tetramer formation is critical for p53 post-translational modification and its ability to activate or repress the transcription of target genes vital in inhibiting tumor growth. About 50% of human tumors have TP53 gene mutations; most are missense ones that presumably lower the tumor suppressor activity of p53. In this study, we explored the effects of known tumor-derived missense mutations on the stability and oligomeric structure of p53; our comprehensive, quantitative analyses encompassed the tetramerization domain peptides representing 49 such substitutions in humans. Their effects on tetrameric structure were broad, and the stability of the mutant peptides varied widely (ΔT(m) = 4.8 ∼ -46.8 °C). Because formation of a tetrameric structure is critical for protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, and the post-translational modification of p53, a small destabilization of the tetrameric structure could result in dysfunction of tumor suppressor activity. We suggest that the threshold for loss of tumor suppressor activity in terms of the disruption of the tetrameric structure of p53 could be extremely low. However, other properties of the tetramerization domain, such as electrostatic surface potential and its ability to bind partner proteins, also may be important.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

(3) The effects of the 4 missense mutations on the protein structure were analyzed. (4) The clinical phenotype of the patients with PKU were analyzed, according to their blood Phe levels prior to treatment and the Phe tolerance.

This antibody binds to 40,900 sites per platelet, with a Kd = 0.95 microM, and its binding is inhibited by the presence of magnesium or calcium in the suspending medium (50% suppression at approximately 0.5 mM divalent cation). Regulation of the PMI-1 epitope is independent of disassembly of the GPIIb-IIIa heterodimer, because it occurred at 22 degrees C and in response to mM magnesium as well as calcium. PMI-1 binding inversely correlated with fibrinogen binding. In addition, we identified a variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia with near-normal platelet content of the GPIIb-IIIa heterodimer as judged by crossed immunoelectrophoresis and surface labeling. Binding of PMI-1 to these patients' platelets was not dependent on reduction of the divalent cation concentration.

Although measurement of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity in fibroblasts remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of GSDII, analysis of the GAA gene allows confirmation of clinical or biochemical diagnoses and permits predictive and prenatal testing of individuals at risk of developing GSDII. We have developed a clinical molecular test for the detection of GAA mutations based on cycle sequencing of the complete coding region. GAA exons 2-20 are amplified in six independent PCR using intronic primers. The resulting products were purified and sequenced. Preliminary studies using this protocol were conducted with DNA from 21 GSDII-affected individuals from five centers across Canada. In total, 41 of 42 mutations were detected (96.7% detection rate). Mutations spanned intron 1 through exon 19 and included nine novel mutations. Haplotype analysis of recurrent mutations further suggested that three of these mutations are likely to have occurred independently at least twice. Additionally, we report the identification of the c.-32-13T>G GAA mutation in an individual with infantile variant GSDII, despite reports of this mutation being associated almost exclusively with late-onset forms of the disease.

A high number of sequence variations have been described in the GJB2 gene and the associated pathogenic effects are not always clearly established. The prevalence of a number of mutations is known to be population specific, and therefore population specific testing should be a prerequisite step when molecular diagnosis is offered. Moreover, population studies are needed to determine the contribution of GJB2 variants to deafness. We present our findings from the molecular diagnostic screening of the GJB2 and GJB6 genes over a three year period, together with a population-based study of GJB2 variants.
Molecular studies were performed using denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatograghy (DHPLC) and sequencing of the GJB2 gene. Over the last 3 years we have studied 159 families presenting sensorineural hearing loss, including 84 with non syndromic, stable, bilateral deafness. Thirty families were genotyped with causative mutations. In parallel, we have performed a molecular epidemiology study on more than 3000 dried blood spots and established the frequency of the GJB2 variants in our population. Finally, we have compared the prevalence of the variants in the hearing impaired population with the general population.
Although a high heterogeneity of sequence variation was observed in patients and controls, the 35delG mutation remains the most common pathogenic mutation in our population. Genetic counseling is dependent on the knowledge of the pathogenicity of the mutations and remains difficult in a number of cases. By comparing the sequence variations observed in hearing impaired patients with those sequence variants observed in general population, from the same ethnic background, we show that the M34T, V37I and R127H variants can not be responsible for profound or severe deafness.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

We categorized 2,016 genes linked with Mendelian diseases into ""bins"" based on clinical utility and validity, and used a computational algorithm to analyze 80 whole-genome sequences in order to explore the use of such an approach in a simulated real-world setting.
The algorithm effectively reduced the number of variants requiring human review and identified incidental variants with likely clinical relevance. Incorporation of the Human Gene Mutation Database improved the yield for missense mutations but also revealed that a substantial proportion of purported disease-causing mutations were misleading.

On the basis of our clinical observations of several patients with EGID-PHTS, we investigated whether there is an association between these 2 disorders.
The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) warehouse was queried for the years 2007 to 2012 using International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for PTEN-related diseases; the results were cross-referenced with participants enrolled in the Cincinnati Center for Eosinophilic Disorder's EGID database to identify patients with both disorders. In an effort to replicate our findings, the Cleveland Clinic Genomic Medicine Institute PTEN database was queried for cases between 2005 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were age ≤ 18 years, history of PHTS, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or colonoscopy with at least 1 histologic EGID diagnosis confirmed by a CCHMC pathologist. The Pearson χ(2) test was used to determine the odds of EGID enrichment in PHTS.
Of the 1,058,260 CCHMC distinct patients identified by the i2b2 search, 53 had clinical diagnoses suggestive of PHTS. Thirteen of the 53 had PTEN mutations, with 8 of 13 (62%) having had an EGD and/or colonoscopy. Five of the 8 had confirmed EGID. At the Cleveland Clinic, 3 of 75 patients (3/4 who had EGD and/or colonoscopy) with PHTS had confirmed EGID. CCHMC i2b2 query data showed a substantial enrichment of EGIDs in PHTSs (odds ratio  272; confidence interval 89-831, P < 0.0001). An EGID prevalence estimate from the i2b2 query supported a marked enrichment of EGIDs in PHTSs in the Cleveland Clinic database (P < 0.0001). Among the 8 subjects with EGIDs and PHTSs, the age at EGID and PHTS diagnosis was 7.6 ± 3.2 and 7.9 ± 5.8 years, respectively.

Thirty-eight HCM index patients (mean age 60±16 years) underwent systematic mutation screening of eight sarcomeric genes: β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), troponin T (TNNT2), troponin I (TNNI3), myosin ventricular regulatory light chain 2 (MYL2), myosin ventricular essential light chain 1 (MYL3), α-tropomyosin (TPM1), and cardiac α-actin (ACTC), using direct DNA sequencing. In silico programs predicted damaging amino acids. In the positive families, genotype-phenotype correlation studies were done.
Overall, 13 mutations were identified in 13 index patients (34.2%). The three most frequently mutated genes were MYH7, MYBPC3, and TNNT2. One patient carried double mutations. Five mutations (MYH7 R147S; MYBPC3 R597Q; MYBPC3 W1007R; TNNI3 E124Q; MYL3 R63C) were novel; all were missense mutations. Analysis using in silico tools showed near consensus to classify these five novel mutations as pathological. Family pedigree analysis showed the presence of cosegregation in at least two affected members in each proband family, but incomplete penetrance in young family members with a positive genotype.
We identified 13 HCM pedigrees, including 5 carrying novel mutations and 1 with a double mutation. The three most commonly mutated genes were MYH7, MYBPC3, and TNNT2. These results, together with genetic counseling, could lead to earlier diagnosis and better management of family members at risk of HCM.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
27995193,"Background and study aims:Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HGGC), an autosomal dominant tumor-syndrome, accounts for 1 % to 3 % of gastric cancers worldwide. Presumably 30 % to 40 % of all patients fulfilling the clinical guidelines for HDGC are carriers of a pathogenic mutation in theCDH1gene. Patients often show multiple foci of signet ring cell carcinoma at early age and are advised to undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG). Our aim was to improve the endoscopic detection of HDGC by using an enhanced endoscopic protocol.Patient and methods:Patients with a provenCDH1germline mutation identified in our institute were prospectively included. Patients were advised to undergo PTG and offered a baseline endoscopic examination prior surgery. Examination was performed by using high-resolution white-light endoscopy and pan-gastric chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine as dye combined with targeted and multiple random biopsies assessed by an expert histopathologist. Postoperative histopathology was compared with results from endoscopic biopsies.Results:Between September 2012 and November 2014 8 patients with a provenCDH1germline mutation were included. We conducted 44 targeted (6.3/patient) and 225 random (32.1/patient) biopsies in 7 patients. We detected 1 gastric cancer by random biopsy (14 %). All other examinations showed no signs of cancer. Histopathology of gastrectomy specimen revealed multiple foci of gastric carcinoma in 6 patients (86 %) with a total number of 27 cancer foci.Conclusions:Examination with targeted and random biopsies combined with chromoendoscopy is not able to detect small foci of gastric cancer inCDH1mutation carriers.

The present study was carried out for mutation analysis of the PAH gene in West Azerbaijan province of Iran.
A total of 218 alleles from 40 PKU families were studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) method.
The frequencies of IVS10-11, S67P, R261Q, R252W, IVS11nt-1 g>c, R408Q, and Q232Q mutations were 28(35), 17(21.25), 15(18.75), 3(3.75), 3(3.75), 2(2.5), and 1(1.25), in cases group, and 51(23.4), 31(14.2), 27(12.4), 6(2.75), 6(2.75), 4(1.83), and 2(0.92) in total group, respectively. The mutations of R243Q, 364delG, L333F, 261X, I65T, and R408W were not detected in our samples.

The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered.
We have investigated 41 carriers of RUNX1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated French families with FPD/AML and two syndromic patients, registered in the French network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015.
Five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including RUNX1 were evidenced. The history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of FPD/AML in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. Additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. Bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/L), with normal platelet volume. A functional platelet defect consistent with a δ-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of RUNX1 alteration. The incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated RUNX1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). A normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of FPD/AML, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective δ-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of FPD/AML particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. The genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
1682235,"A deletion of a single base in codon 55 (exon 2) of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene has been identified by direct DNA sequencing of 94 phenylketonuria (PKU) chromosomes. This mutation alters the reading frame so that a stop signal (TAA) is generated in codon 60 of the PAH gene. Haplotype analysis revealed that all PKU alleles showing the codon 55 frameshift mutation exhibited haplotype 1. In our panel of DNA probes 13% of all mutant haplotype 1 alleles carry this particular mutation. Patients who were compound heterozygotes for this deletion and R408W in exon 12, or the splice mutation in intron 12, were affected by severe PKU. Thus, the clinical data provide additional evidence that haplotype 1 PKU alleles carry molecular defects which confer a null phenotype.

The spectrums and frequencies of GJB2 variants vary substantially among different ethnic groups, and the genotypes among these populations remain poorly understood. In the present study, we carried out a systematic and extended mutational screening of GJB2 gene in 1067 Han Chinese subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss, and the resultant GJB2 variants were evaluated by phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 25 (23 known and 2 novel) GJB2 variants were identified, including 6 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 16 missense mutations and 2 silent mutations. In this cohort, c.235delC is the most frequently observed pathogenic mutation. The phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis showed that 2 novel variants c.127G>T (p.V43L), c.293G>C (p.R98P) and 2 known variants c. 107T>C (p.L36P) and c.187G>T (p.V63L) are localized at highly conserved amino acids. In addition, these 4 mutations are absent in 203 healthy individuals, therefore, they are probably the most likely candidate pathogenic mutations. In addition, 66 (24 novel and 42 known) genotypes were identified, including 6 homozygotes, 20 compound heterozygotes, 18 single heterozygotes, 21 genotypes harboring only polymorphism(s) and the wild type genotype. Among these, 153 (14.34%) subjects were homozygous for pathogenic mutations, 63 (5.91%) were compound heterozygotes, and 157 (14.71%) carried single heterozygous mutation. Furthermore, 65.28% (141/216) of these cases with two pathogenic mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. These data suggested that mutations in GJB2 gene are responsible for approximately 34.96% of non-syndromic hearing loss in Han Chinese population from Zhejiang Province in eastern China. In addition, our results also strongly supported the idea that other factors such as alterations in regulatory regions, additional genes, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical manifestation of deafness.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
32546644,"BecauseBRCA1is a high-risk breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene,BRCA1sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) complicate genetic counseling. As most VUS are rare, reliable classification based on clinical and genetic data is often impossible. However, all pathogenicBRCA1variants analyzed result in defective homologous recombination DNA repair (HRR). Thus,BRCA1VUS may be categorized based on their functional impact on this pathway.
Two hundred thirty-eightBRCA1VUS-comprising mostBRCA1VUS known in the Netherlands and Belgium-were tested for their ability to complementBrca1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells in HRR, using cisplatin and olaparib sensitivity assays and a direct repeat GFP (DR-GFP) HRR assay. Assays were validated using 25 known benign and 25 known pathogenicBRCA1variants. For assessment of pathogenicity by a multifactorial likelihood analysis method, we collected clinical and genetic data for functionally deleterious VUS and VUS occurring in three or more families.
All three assays showed 100% sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval, 83%-100%). Out of 238 VUS, 45 showed functional defects, 26 of which were deleterious in all three assays. For 13 of these 26 variants, we could calculate the probability of pathogenicity using clinical and genetic data, resulting in the identification of 7 (likely) pathogenic variants.
We have functionally categorized 238BRCA1VUS using three different HRR-related assays. Classification based on clinical and genetic data alone for a subset of these variants confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of our functional assays.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Its variation in the Ashkenazim is highly distinctive, with four major and numerous minor founders. However, due to their rarity in the general population, these founders have been difficult to trace to a source. Here we show that all four major founders, ~40% of Ashkenazi mtDNA variation, have ancestry in prehistoric Europe, rather than the Near East or Caucasus. Furthermore, most of the remaining minor founders share a similar deep European ancestry. Thus the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, as commonly supposed, nor recruited in the Caucasus, as sometimes suggested, but assimilated within Europe. These results point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities, and provide the foundation for a detailed reconstruction of Ashkenazi genealogical history.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

MPS I covers a broad spectrum of clinical severity ranging from severe Hurler syndrome through intermediate Hurler/Scheie syndrome to mild Scheie syndrome. Mutation screening was performed in two unrelated Taiwanese MPS I patients. A Hurler/Scheie patient had A79V (C to T transition in codon 79) in exon 2 and R619G (C to G transversion in codon 619) in exon 14. R619G has been shown to cause disease. Expression of A79V in COS-7 cells showed trace amounts of IDUA activity, demonstrating the deleterious nature of the mutation. A79V mutation did not cause a reduction in IDUA mRNA levels. The reduced level of IDUA protein suggests increased degradation of the mutant enzyme. A Hurler patient had 134del12 (in-frame deletion of codons 16-19 in signal peptide) in exon 1 and Q584X (C to T transition in codon 584) in exon 13. Transfection of COS-7 cells with Q584X did not yield active enzyme. Q584X mutation caused an apparent reduction in the IDUA mRNA level and no IDUA protein was detected. Conversely, 134del12 showed 124.6% of normal activity in transfected cells and a 77-kDa precursor protein was observed on Western blot, suggesting biologic activity of precursor IDUA without posttranslational cleavage.

26763877,"The diagnosis of the genetic etiology of deafness contributes to the clinical management of patients. We performed the following four genetic tests in three stages for 52 consecutive deafness subjects in one facility. We used the Invader assay for 46 mutations in 13 genes and Sanger sequencing for the GJB2 gene or SLC26A4 gene in the first-stage test, the TaqMan genotyping assay in the second-stage test and targeted exon sequencing using massively parallel DNA sequencing in the third-stage test. Overall, we identified the genetic cause in 40% (21/52) of patients. The diagnostic rates of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and sporadic cases were 50%, 60% and 34%, respectively. When the sporadic cases with congenital and severe hearing loss were selected, the diagnostic rate rose to 48%. The combination approach using these genetic tests appears to be useful as a diagnostic tool for deafness patients. We recommended that genetic testing for the screening of common mutations in deafness genes using the Invader assay or TaqMan genotyping assay be performed as the initial evaluation.

Here, we describe patients with craniosynostosis and Noonan syndrome due to de novo mutations in PTPN11 and patients with craniosynostosis and CFC syndrome due to de novo mutations in BRAF or KRAS. All of these patients had cranial deformities in addition to the typical phenotypes of CFC syndrome and Noonan syndrome.

10377006,"Genetic deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) results in the autosomal recessive disorder glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) in which intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen primarily affects function of skeletal and cardiac muscle. During an earlier review we noted 3 in 100 cases of GSDII with incidental description of cleft lip. In addition, we identified 2 of 35 GSDII patients referred to us for molecular studies with co-occurence of cleft lip, considerably greater than the estimated frequency of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate of 1 in 700 to 1,000. Because several lines of evidence support a minor cleft lip/palate (Cl/P) locus on chromosome 17q close to the locus for GSDII, we defined the molecular basis for the GSDII in these two patients to determine if they represented a contiguous gene syndrome. Patient I (of Dutch descent) was homozygous and the parents heterozygous for an intragenic deletion of exon 18 (deltaex18), common in Dutch patients. Patient II was heterozygous for delta525T, a mutation also common in Dutch patients and a novel nonsense mutation (172 [corrected] C-->T; Gln58Stop) in exon 2, the first coding exon. The mother was heterozygous for the delta525T and the father for the 172 [corrected] C-->T; Gln58Stop. The finding that both patients carried intragenic mutations eliminates a contiguous gene syndrome. Whereas the presence of cleft lip/cleft palate in a patient with GSDII could be coincidental, these co-occurences could represent a modifying action of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency on unlinked or linked genes that result in increased susceptibility for cleft lip.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Several neurological symptoms are also part of CD with megalencephaly and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) as the most important features. Early recognition of CD patients is important because of the increased risk of developing malignancies. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy, but also urogenital, digestive tract, and thyroid cancers are found with higher frequencies. CD was localised to chromosome 10q23 and the PTEN gene (also known as MMAC1 or TEP1) was shown to be involved. Germline mutations were identified in both familial and sporadic CD patients. We identified eight PTEN mutations, of which seven were novel, in 13 CD patients. Combined with previous data we have identified 17 independent CD mutations. Gross DNA alterations in CD patients were not detected. Genotype-phenotype relations are discussed. The only correlation suggested to exist is that missense mutations are not detected in LDD patients. However, larger numbers are needed to confirm this. Association of PTEN mutations and the occurrence of malignant breast disease found in an earlier study cannot be confirmed. Clinical features of five CD patients without a PTEN mutation in the coding sequence do not differ from CD patients with a PTEN mutation. Furthermore, it is likely that we have identified the majority of CD patients in the Netherlands.

Here, we functionally characterized the motor domains of five DCM-causing mutations in human β-cardiac myosin. Kinetic analyses of the individual events in the ATPase cycle revealed that each mutation alters different steps in this cycle. For example, different mutations gave enhanced or reduced rate constants of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or ADP release or exhibited altered ATP, ADP, or actin affinity. Local effects dominated, no common pattern accounted for the similar mutant phenotype, and there was no distinct set of changes that distinguished DCM mutations from previously analyzed HCM myosin mutations. That said, using our data to model the complete ATPase contraction cycle revealed additional critical insights. Four of the DCM mutations lowered the duty ratio (the ATPase cycle portion when myosin strongly binds actin) because of reduced occupancy of the force-holding A·M·D complex in the steady state. Under load, the A·M·D state is predicted to increase owing to a reduced rate constant for ADP release, and this effect was blunted for all five DCM mutations. We observed the opposite effects for two HCM mutations, namely R403Q and R453C. Moreover, the analysis predicted more economical use of ATP by the DCM mutants than by WT and the HCM mutants. Our findings indicate that DCM mutants have a deficit in force generation and force-holding capacity due to the reduced occupancy of the force-holding state.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Extraordinarily, this mutation has attained homoplasmy (100% mutated mt-tRNA(Glu)) on at least three independent occasions in this family and has done so in one individual who remains asymptomatic with no clinical evidence of disease. Heteroplasmy (dual populations of mutated and wild-type mtDNA) usually is regarded as one of the primary diagnostic criteria for pathogenicity and previous reports of the T14709C mutation detail heteroplasmy in a variety of tissues. In contrast, homoplasmy of mt-tRNA mutations generally has been regarded as evidence of a benign nature, with rare exceptions that result in organ-specific phenotypes. Discovering that T14709C, a common and severe mt-tRNA mutation, can attain homoplasmy without symptoms or clinical signs of disease has profound implications for the identification and prevalence of other pathogenic mt-tRNA mutations.

The mutation was identified in a patient with a glioma, and turned out to be a heterozygous germline mutation of PTEN (Arg234Gln), without loss of heterozygosity in tumour DNA. The biological consequences of this germline mutation were investigated by means of transfection studies of the mutant PTEN molecule compared to wild-type PTEN. In contrast to the wild-type molecule, the mutant PTEN protein is not capable of inducing apoptosis, induces increased cell proliferation and leads to high constitutive PKB/Akt activation, which cannot be increased anymore by stimulation with insulin. The reported patient, in addition to glioma, had suffered from benign meningioma in the past but did not show any clinical signs of Cowden disease or other hereditary diseases typically associated with PTEN germline mutations. The functional consequences of the mutation in transfection studies are consistent with high proliferative activity.

We diagnosed 30 LOPD patients; at follow-up, they underwent motor, respiratory, cardiac and muscle MRI evaluations. Motor performances were tested by Walton Gardner-Medwin, GSGC and 6MWT tests. Respiratory function was assessed as FVC% in upright/supine position. LOPD presentations were represented by presymptomatic hyperCKemia (37%), proximal/axial muscle weakness (53%) and respiratory impairment (10%). Median diagnostic delay was 8.6 years (± 8.8). Atypical features were observed in 4 patients: marked distal muscle weakness and severe hearing loss at onset, as well as leukoencephalopathy and mesial temporal sclerosis during the disease course.

To investigate the molecular basis of the polymorphism underlying the Pen alloantigen system, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify platelet-derived GPIIIa mRNA transcripts. DNA sequence analysis of amplified GPIIIa cDNAs from nucleotides 161 to 1341 (encompassing amino acid residues 22-414) revealed a G526<==>A526 polymorphism that segregated precisely with Pen phenotype in twelve other individuals examined. This nucleotide substitution results in an Arg (CGA) to Gln (CAA) polymorphism at amino acid 143 of GPIIIa. Interestingly, this polymorphic residue is located within the putative RGD binding site (residues 109-171) of GPIIIa. Platelet aggregation patterns of a Penb/b individual, however, were nearly normal in response to all physiological agonists tested, indicating that this polymorphism does not grossly affect integrin function. Short synthetic peptides encompassing residue 143 were unable to mimic either the Pena or Penb antigenic determinants, suggesting that the Pen epitopes are dependent upon proper folding of the polypeptide chain. Finally, we constructed allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIIIa that differed only at amino acid residues 143. Whereas anti-Pena alloantibodies were able to recognize the Arg143 recombinant form of GPIIIa, anti-Penb antibodies were not. Conversely, anti-Penb alloantibodies were reactive only with the Gln143 isoform of the GPIIIa molecule. It thus appears that amino acid 143 of GPIIIa is not only associated with Pen phenotype, but specifically controls the formation and expression of the Pen alloantigenic determinants.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 somatic substitution hotspots in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position- and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2.

Analytic approaches initially focused on 475 known or candidate PIDD genes but were nonexclusive and further tailored based on clinical data, family history, and immunophenotyping.
A likely molecular diagnosis was achieved in 110 (40%) unrelated probands. Clinical diagnosis was revised in about half (60/110) and management was directly altered in nearly a quarter (26/110) of families based on molecular findings. Twelve PIDD-causing CNVs were detected, including 7 smaller than 30 Kb that would not have been detected with conventional diagnostic CNV arrays.
This high-throughput genomic approach enabled detection of disease-related variants in unexpected genes; permitted detection of low-grade constitutional, somatic, and revertant mosaicism; and provided evidence of a mutational burden in mixed PIDD immunophenotypes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
32106880,"Phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM#261600) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene resulting in high phenylalanine (Phe) in blood and brain. If not treated early this results in intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric problems, microcephaly, motor deficits, eczematous rash, autism, seizures, and developmental problems. There is a controversial discussion of whether patients with PKU have an additional risk for atherosclerosis due to interference of Phe with cholesterol synthesis and LDL-cholesterol regulation. Since cholesterol also plays a role in membrane structure and myelination, better insight into the clinical significance of the impact of Phe on lipoprotein metabolism is desirable. In 22 treated PKU patients (mean age 38.7 years) and 14 healthy controls (mean age 35.2 years), we investigated plasma with NMR spectroscopy and quantified 105 lipoprotein parameters (including lipoprotein subclasses) and 24 low molecular weight parameters. Analysis was performed on a 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE IVDr spectrometer as previously described.
Concurrent plasma Phe in PKU patients showed a wide range with a mean of 899 μmol/L (50-1318 μmol/L). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in PKU patients versus controls: 179.4 versus 200.9 mg/dL (p < 0.02) and 79.5 versus 104.1 mg/dL (p < 0.0038), respectively. PKU patients also had lower levels of 22 LDL subclasses with the greatest differences in LDL2 Apo-B, LDL2 Particle Number, LDL2-phospholipids, and LDL2-cholesterol (p < 0.0001). There was a slight negative correlation of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol with concurrent Phe level. VLDL5-free cholesterol, VLDL5-cholesterol, VLDL5-phospholipids, and VLDL4-free cholesterol showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation with concurrent Phe level. There was no difference in HDL and their subclasses between PKU patients and controls. Tyrosine, glutamine, and creatinine were significantly lower in PKU patients compared to controls, while citric and glutamic acids were significantly higher.
Using NMR spectroscopy, a unique lipoprotein profile in PKU patients can be demonstrated which mimics a non-atherogenic profile as seen in patients treated by statins.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
22765922,"MYH7 mutations are found in ~20% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. Currently, mutational analysis is based on the sequencing of the coding exons and a few exon-flanking intronic nucleotides, resulting in omission of single-exon deletions and mutations in internal intronic, promoter, and 3' UTR regions. We amplified and sequenced large MYH7 fragments in 60 HCM patients without previously identified sarcomere mutations. Lack of aberrant PCR fragments excluded single-exon deletions in the patients. Instead, we identified several new rare intronic variants. An intron 26 single nucleotide insertion (-5 insC) was predicted to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but allele frequencies did not differ between patients and controls (n = 150). We found several rare promoter variants in the patients compared to controls, some of which were in binding sites for transcription factors and could thus affect gene expression. Only one rare 3' UTR variant (c.*29T>C) found in the patients was absent among the controls. This nucleotide change would not affect the binding of known microRNAs. Therefore, MYH7 mutations outside the coding exon sequences would be rarely found among HCM patients. However, changes in the promoter region could be linked to the risk of developing HCM. Further research to define the functional effect of these variants on gene expression is necessary to confirm the role of the MYH7 promoter in cardiac hypertrophy.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
7914195,Rat phenylalanine hydroxylase was expressed in Escherichia coli. High level expression was achieved when the transformed E. coli were incubated at 27 degrees C for 24 h. A series of truncated fragments were expressed. The smallest fragment that gave an active soluble protein was from Leu142 to Phe410. This fragment corresponds closely to the region where there is highest homology between the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. The circular dichroism spectra of the phenylalanine hydroxylase catalytic core suggested that it contains around 50% alpha-helix. The core fragment is monomeric in dilute solutions but self-associates at higher concentrations. The E. coli expression system was used to generate a number of mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase from position 264 to 290. This region had been previously shown to be important for pterin binding. Characterization of the mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase molecules identified Glu286 as an amino acid critical for pterin function in phenylalanine hydroxylase.,non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

26534844,"Gene panel testing for breast cancer susceptibility has become relatively cheap and accessible. However, the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in many genes included in these panels are unknown.
We performed custom-designed targeted sequencing covering the coding exons of 17 known and putative breast cancer susceptibility genes in 660 non-BRCA1/2 women with familial breast cancer. Putative deleterious mutations were genotyped in relevant family members to assess co-segregation of each variant with disease. We used maximum likelihood models to estimate the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in each of the genes.
We found 31 putative deleterious mutations in 7 known breast cancer susceptibility genes (TP53, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, CDH1, PTEN and STK11) in 45 cases, and 22 potential deleterious mutations in 31 cases in 8 other genes (BARD1, BRIP1, MRE11, NBN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D and CDK4). The relevant variants were then genotyped in 558 family members. Assuming a constant relative risk of breast cancer across age groups, only variants in CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and TP53 showed evidence of a significantly increased risk of breast cancer, with some supportive evidence that mutations in ATM confer moderate risk.
Panel testing for these breast cancer families provided additional relevant clinical information for <2% of families. We demonstrated that segregation analysis has some potential to help estimate the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, but very large case-control sequencing studies and/or larger family-based studies will be needed to define the risks more accurately.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
23431106,"To give a comprehensive report of E-cadherin gene (CDH1) variations in a population at a high risk for gastric cancer (GC).
The samples consisted of 178 men and 58 women with a mean age of 62.3 ± 9.4 years and an age range of 30-84 years. A total of 240 cancer-free controls were recruited (mean age of 61.8 ± 10.1 years, age range of 26-82 years). Samples were screened for CDH1 germline mutations by high-resolution melting analysis or directly sequencing. Luciferase reporter assay, RNA splicing assay and bioinformatic analysis were used to evaluate the effect of mutations.
Four novel CDH1 sequence alterations were identified in GC patients including a G>T transition 49 bp before the start codon; a three-nucleotide deletion, c.44_46del TGC; one missense mutation, c.604G>A (V202I); and one variation in the intron, c.1320+7A>G. In addition, polymorphism frequencies were observed for CDH1-164delT, -161C>A, -73A>C, c.48+6C>T, c.48+62_48+63delinsCGTGCCCCAGCCC, c.894C>T (A298A), c.1224G>A (A408A), c.1888C>G (L630V), c.2076T>C (A692A), and c.2253C>T (N751N) which is similar to the data reported in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/. RNA splicing analysis suggested that the c.1320+7A>G and c.1224G>A variations did not affect exon splicing ability. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the c.-49T variation might be helpful for E-cadherin transcription, though the increase in transcription activity is limited (only 33%). SIFT score and PolyPhen analysis both demonstrated that the L630V missense mutation probably damages protein function, while the V202I variant does not.

After excluding patients with GJB2 mutations and mitochondrial m.1555A > G and m.3243A > G mutations, subjects for CDH23 mutation analysis were selected according to the following criteria: 1) Sporadic or recessively inherited hearing loss 2) bilateral non-syndromic congenital hearing loss, 3) no cochlear malformation, 4) a poorer hearing level at high frequencies than at low frequencies, and 5) severe or profound hearing loss at higher frequencies.
Seventy-two subjects were selected from 621 consecutive probands who did not have environmental causes for their hearing loss. After direct sequencing, 13 of the 72 probands (18.1%) had homozygous or compound heterozygous CDH23 mutations. In total, we identified 16 CDH23 mutations, including five novel mutations. The 16 mutations included 12 missense, two frameshift, and two splice-site mutations.
These results revealed that CDH23 mutations are highly prevalent in patients with congenital high-frequency sporadic or recessively inherited hearing loss and that the mutation spectrum was diverse, indicating that patients with these clinical features merit genetic analysis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
22738334,"Fetal-neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) diagnosis relies on maternofetal incompatibility and alloantibody identification. Genotyping for rare platelet (PLT) polymorphisms allowed the identification of three families with suspected or confirmed maternofetal incompatibility for the αIIb-c.2614C>A mutation (Halle et al., Transfusion 2008;48:14-15).
A polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers amplification assay was designed to genotype the αIIb-c.2614C>A mutation. HEK293 cells expressing αIIb-Leu841 or αIIb-Met841 αIIbβ3 forms were used to probe the reactivity of maternal sera from these families and to study the effects of the substitution on αIIbβ3 expression and functions.
Tested by flow cytometry (FCM), one serum sample specifically reacted with αIIb-Met841 but not with αIIb-Leu841 αIIbβ3. This specificity revealed the αIIb-Leu841 polymorphism as a new alloantigen named Cab3(a+) . Cross-match testing using FCM also showed the Cab3(a+) antigen to be expressed at the PLT surface. As for anti-human PLT alloantigen (HPA)-3a (or -3b) and anti-HPA-9bw, detection of anti-Cab3(a+) alloantibodies appeared difficult and required whole PLT assays when classical monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization of PLT antigen test failed. In our FNAIT set, the immune response to Cab3(a+) maternofetal incompatibility could induce severe thrombocytopenias and life-threatening hemorrhages. The p.Leu841Met substitution has limited effects, if any, on local αIIb structure, preserving both αIIbβ3 expression and functions.
The Cab3(a+) polymorphism is a new rare alloantigen (allelic frequency <1%) carried by αIIb that might result in severe life-threatening thrombocytopenias.

Somatic mutations in RUNX1 are preferentially detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M0, myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21, and certain myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. By correlating the presence of RUNX1 mutations with cytogenetic and molecular aberration in a large cohort of AML M0 (N = 90) at diagnosis, we detected RUNX1 mutations in 46% of cases, with all trisomy 13 cases (n = 18) being affected. No mutations of NRAS or KIT were detected in the RUNX1-mutated group and FLT3 mutations were equally distributed between RUNX1-mutated and unmutated samples. Likewise, a high incidence of RUNX1 mutations (80%) was detected in cases with trisomy 13 from other French-American-British (FAB) subgroups (n = 20). As FLT3 is localized on chromosome 13, we hypothesized that RUNX1 mutations might cooperate with trisomy 13 in leukemogenesis by increasing FLT3 transcript levels. Quantitation of FLT3 transcript levels revealed a highly significant (P < .001) about 5-fold increase in AML with RUNX1 mutations and trisomy 13 compared with samples without trisomy 13. The results of the present study indicate that in the absence of FLT3 mutations, FLT3 overexpression might be a mechanism for FLT3 activation, which cooperates with RUNX1 mutations in leukemogenesis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

In this study, we analyzed the GJB2 gene for mutations in 1227 hearing-impaired Japanese individuals. This revealed a unique spectrum of GJB2 mutations, different from that found in the Caucasian population. The most frequent mutation in Japanese, 235delC, has never been reported in Caucasians. To investigate a possible founder effect for the 235delC mutation, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vicinity of the GJB2 gene.

Usher syndrome type ID, one of seven Usher syndrome type I genetic localizations, have been mapped to a chromosomal interval that overlaps with a nonsyndromic-deafness localization, DFNB12. Mutations in CDH23, a gene that encodes a putative cell-adhesion protein with multiple cadherin-like domains, are responsible for both Usher syndrome and DFNB12 nonsyndromic deafness. Specific CDH23 mutational defects have been identified that differentiate these two phenotypes. Only missense mutations of CDH23 have been observed in families with nonsyndromic deafness, whereas nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and missense mutations have been identified in families with Usher syndrome. In the present study, a panel of 69 probands with Usher syndrome and 38 probands with recessive nonsyndromic deafness were screened for the presence of mutations in the entire coding region of CDH23, by heteroduplex, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and direct sequence analyses. A total of 36 different CDH23 mutations were detected in 45 families; 33 of these mutations were novel, including 18 missense, 3 nonsense, 5 splicing defects, 5 microdeletions, and 2 insertions. A total of seven mutations were common to more than one family. Numerous exonic and intronic polymorphisms also were detected. Results of ophthalmologic examinations of the patients with nonsyndromic deafness have found asymptomatic RP-like manifestations, indicating that missense mutations may have a subtle effect in the retina.

To investigate the molecular basis for this altered expression we developed a comprehensive PCR/SSCP mutation screen for the human E-cadherin gene. For 49 breast cancer patients the occurrence of tumour-specific mutations in the E-cadherin gene was examined. No relevant DNA changes were encountered in any of 42 infiltrative ductal or medullary breast carcinoma samples. In contrast, four out of seven infiltrative lobular breast carcinomas harboured protein truncation mutations (three nonsense and one frameshift) in the extracellular part of the E-cadherin protein. Each of the four lobular carcinomas with E-cadherin mutations showed tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal region 16q22.1 containing the E-cadherin locus.

We identified eight inactivating and one missense CDH1 germ line mutation. The missense mutation conferred in vitro loss of protein function. Two families had the previously described 1003C>T nonsense mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed this to be a recurrent and not a founder mutation. Thirty-six percent (5 of 14) of the families with a documented DGC diagnosed before the age of 50 and other cases of gastric cancer carried CDH1 germ line mutations. Two of 10 isolated cases of DGC in individuals ages <35 years harbored CDH1 germ line mutations. One mutation positive family was ascertained through a family history of lobular breast cancer (LBC) and another through an individual with both DGC and LBC. Occult DGC was identified in five of six prophylactic gastrectomies done on asymptomatic, endoscopically negative 1003C>T mutation carriers.
In addition to families with a strong history of early-onset DGC, CDH1 mutation screening should be offered to isolated cases of DGC in individuals ages <35 years and for families with multiple cases of LBC, with any history of DGC or unspecified GI malignancies.

Wild-type recombinant VWF and human plasma VWF from healthy controls bound myosin, whereas plasma lacking VWF exhibited no detectable myosin binding. Binding was multimer dependent and blocked by anti-VWF A1 domain antibodies or A1 domain VWF variants. The specific residues involved in myosin binding were similar, but not identical, to those required for collagen IV binding. FVIII did not bind myosin directly, but FVIII activity was detected when VWF and FVIII were bound to myosin. Myosin enhanced thrombin generation in platelet-poor plasma, although no difference was detected with the addition of myosin to platelet-rich plasma. Myosin may help to facilitate delivery of FVIII to sites of injury and indirectly accelerate thrombin generation by providing a surface for VWF binding in the setting of trauma and myosin exposure.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
17309986,"To correlate genetic and audiometric findings with a detailed radiologic analysis of the temporal bone in patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) to ascertain the contribution of SLC26A4 gene mutations to this phenotype.
A retrospective review of patients with EVA identified in a database of pediatric hearing-impaired patients.
A tertiary care pediatric referral center.
Seventy-one children with EVA and screening results for SLC26A4 mutations.
Genetic screening results, audiometric thresholds, and radiographic temporal bone measurements.
Seventy-one children with EVA were screened for SLC26A4 mutations. Mutations were found in 27% of children overall, while only 8% had biallelic mutations. The mean initial pure-tone average (PTA) was 59 dB; the mean final PTA was 67 dB. A bilateral EVA was found in 48 (67%) of the children; a unilateral EVA was found in 23 (33%). Progressive hearing loss (in at least 1 ear) was seen in 29 (41%) of the patients. The strongest genotype-phenotype interaction was seen in children with a bilateral EVA. Among children with SLC26A4 mutations, there was a significantly wider vestibular aqueduct at the midpoint and a wider vestibule width (P < .05) than in children without the mutation. Among patients with a bilateral EVA, children with any SLC26A4 mutation were more likely to have a more severe final PTA (64 dB vs 32 dB), larger midpoint measurement (2.1 vs 1.1 mm), and larger operculum measurement (3.0 vs 2.0 mm) than those without the mutation in their better-hearing ear (P < .05).
In a population of pediatric patients with an EVA and hearing loss, SLC26A4 mutations are a contributor to the phenotype. Our data suggest that other genetic factors also have important contributions to this phenotype. The presence of an abnormal SLC26A4 allele, even in the heterozygous state, was associated with greater enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, abnormal development of the vestibule, and possibly a stable hearing outcome.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
20978941,"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by dysfunction of ETHE1, a mitochondrial dioxygenase involved in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detoxification. Patients present in infancy with psychomotor retardation, chronic diarrhea, orthostatic acrocyanosis and relapsing petechiae. High levels of lactic acid, ethymalonic acid (EMA) and methylsuccinic acid (MSA) are detected in body fluids. Several pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology, including isoleucine, methionine and fatty acid metabolism. We report on a 15-month-old male presenting with typical EE associated with a homozygous ETHE1 mutation. We investigated oral isoleucine (150 mg/kg), methionine (100 mg/kg), fatty acid loading tests and isoleucine-restricted diet (200 mg/day) for any effects on several metabolic parameters. Before loading tests or specific dietary interventions, EMA, C4-C5 acylcarnitines and most acylglycines were elevated, indicating functional deficiency of short chain acyl-CoA (SCAD) as well as all branched acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Excretion of EMA and n-butyrylglycine increased following each of the loads, and isoleucine led to increased levels of derivative metabolites. An isoleucine-restricted diet for 8 days corrected some of the abnormalities but led to no obvious clinical improvement and only partial effects on EMA. A principal component analysis supports the inference that these dietary conditions have consistent effects on the global metabolic profile. Our results suggest that multiple pathways modulate EMA levels in EE. They might all interact with H2S toxicity. Prolonged dietary interventions involving the restriction for branched aminoacids, fatty acids and methionine could be discussed as auxiliary therapeutical strategies in EE.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
25823529,"Mutations in USH2A are a common cause of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). Among the most frequently reported USH2A variants, c.2276G>T (p.C759F) has been found in both affected and healthy individuals. The pathogenicity of this variant remains controversial since it was detected in homozygosity in two healthy siblings of a Spanish family (S23), eleven years ago. The fact that these individuals remain asymptomatic today, prompted us to study the presence of other pathogenic variants in this family using targeted resequencing of 26 retinal genes in one of the affected individuals. This approach allowed us to identify one novel pathogenic homozygous mutation in exon 13 of PDE6B (c.1678C>T; p.R560C). This variant cosegregated with the disease and was absent in 200 control individuals. Remarkably, the identified variant in PDE6B corresponds to the mutation responsible of the retinal degeneration in the naturally occurring rd10 mutant mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of the rd10 mice mutation in a RP family. These findings, together with a review of the literature, support the hypothesis that homozygous p.C759F mutations are not pathogenic and led us to exclude the implication of p.C759F in the RP of family S23. Our results indicate the need of re-evaluating all families genetically diagnosed with this mutation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

We set out to outline the role of CDH1 in HDGC. Investigation of a family suspected as having HDGC is discussed. The role of surgery in the management of affected individuals is then examined.
A search was conducted of Medline and the National Library of Medicine to identify key articles concerning CDH1 gene mutations, familial gastric cancer and gastrectomy. Further, relevant articles were obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified papers. Mutation-specific CDH1 genetic testing was performed on six living family members and on gastric tissue obtained from two deceased members.
CDH1 mutations cause inactivation of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Carriers of the CDH1 germline gene mutation develop an aggressive, diffuse, submucosal gastric cancer at an early age. Current endoscopic screening is ineffective at detecting HDGC. The presence of a CDH1 germline gene mutation was confirmed in both deceased family members and also in four of the six living members tested.
Genetic counselling and CDH1 gene mutation testing is indicated in families with suspected HDGC. In the absence of a satisfactory surveillance mechanism, prophylactic total gastrectomy would appear to be an appropriate therapeutic option in mutation carriers.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
9799096,"The molecular basis for the metabolic defect in patients with phenylketonuria has been characterized for seven missense point mutations (R252G/Q, L255V/S, A259V/T and R270S) and a termination mutation (G272X) in an evolutionarily conserved motif of exon 7 in the catalytic domain of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) gene. The mutations were expressed in three heterologous in vitro systems. When expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli five of the mutant proteins demonstrated a defect in the normal ability of hPAH to fold and assemble as homotetramer/dimer, and they were mostly recovered as inactive aggregated forms. Only for the R252Q and L255V mutants were catalytically active tetramer and dimer recovered and for R252G some dimer, i.e. 20% (R252Q, tetramer), 44% (L255V, tetramer) and 4.4% (R252G, dimer) of the activity for the respective wild-type (wt) forms. When expressed by a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system, all the mutant enzymes were recovered as a mixture of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms with a low homospecific activity (i.e. maximum 11% of wt-hPAH for the L255V mutant). When transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (A293) cells a very low level of immunoreactive PAH protein was recovered in spite of normal PAH mRNA levels. All these mutations resulted in variant hPAH proteins which revealed a defect in oligomerization, an increased sensitivity to limited proteolysis in vitro, reduced cellular stability and a variable reduction in their catalytic activity. All these effects seem to result from structural perturbations of the monomer, and based on the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of hPAH, an explanation is provided for the impact of the mutations on the folding and oligomerization of the monomers.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
23825616,"Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a highly effective therapy, CRIM-negative (CN) infantile Pompe disease (IPD) patients typically mount a strong immune response which abrogates the efficacy of ERT, resulting in clinical decline and death. This study was designed to demonstrate that immune tolerance induction (ITI) prevents or diminishes the development of antibody titers, resulting in a better clinical outcome compared to CN IPD patients treated with ERT monotherapy.
We evaluated the safety, efficacy and feasibility of a clinical algorithm designed to accurately identify CN IPD patients and minimize delays between CRIM status determination and initiation of an ITI regimen (combination of rituximab, methotrexate and IVIG) concurrent with ERT. Clinical and laboratory data including measures of efficacy analysis for response to ERT were analyzed and compared to CN IPD patients treated with ERT monotherapy.
Seven CN IPD patients were identified and started on the ITI regimen concurrent with ERT. Median time from diagnosis of CN status to commencement of ERT and ITI was 0.5 months (range: 0.1-1.6 months). At baseline, all patients had significant cardiomyopathy and all but one required respiratory support. The ITI regimen was safely tolerated in all seven cases. Four patients never seroconverted and remained antibody-free. One patient died from respiratory failure. Two patients required another course of the ITI regimen. In addition to their clinical improvement, the antibody titers observed in these patients were much lower than those seen in ERT monotherapy treated CN patients.
The ITI regimen appears safe and efficacious and holds promise in altering the natural history of CN IPD by increasing ERT efficacy. An algorithm such as this substantiates the benefits of accelerated diagnosis and management of CN IPD patients, thus, further supporting the importance of early identification and treatment initiation with newborn screening for IPD.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

They are autosomal dominantly inherited and share common clinical characteristics, including short stature, craniofacial dysmorphisms, congenital heart disease, ectodermal manifestations, and a higher risk for cancer. A molecular diagnosis is a key factor.
To identify PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, and HRAS mutations and compare the main clinical characteristics of patients with molecular confirmation. Population and methods. Children with a clinical diagnosis of RASopathy assessed between August 2013 and February 2017.
Mutations were identified in 71 % (87/122) of patients. The molecular test confirmed diagnosis in 73 % of patients with Noonan syndrome. The most prevalent mutation was c.922A>G (p.Asn308Asp) in the PTPN11 gene. A previously undescribed variant in RAF1 was detected: c.1467G>>C (p.Leu489Phe). Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome was confirmed in 67 % of cases with BRAF mutations. Costello syndrome and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines were confirmed in all cases.
The confirmation of clinical diagnosis allowed for a more accurate differential diagnosis.

27541434,"The goal of this study was to investigate the use of concurrent genetic screening together with standard newborn hearing screening (NHS) in an effort to provide a scientific basis for the beneficial use of concurrent genetic hearing screening in newborns. Our aim was to improve the neonatal detection rate of hearing impairment and the potential for hearing loss, allowing for increased early intervention and potentially allowing for prevention of later onset hearing loss. This information could also be used to increase the effectiveness of genetic counseling regarding hearing impairment.
A total of 9317 neonates from Children's Hospital of Dongguan and Dongguan People's Hospital were included in this study between January 2015 and October 2015. Twenty hotspot hearing-associated mutations of four common deafness- susceptibility genes (GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and MTRNR1) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The results of genetic screening and NHS were concurrently analyzed.
A total of 129 infants (1.38%) exhibited hearing loss as determined by otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing. The genetic screening revealed that 348 (3.74%) individuals had at least one mutant allele. In total, 34 (0.36%) of the neonates carried a causal complement of mutations. The overwhelming majority of the genetically referred newborns passed the OAE hearing screening, but could be at risk for later hearing loss.
This study furthers the understanding of the etiology of hearing loss and proves that it is beneficial to use genetic screening along with OAE screening of neonates to improve detection rates of at-risk infants. Our results show that this concurrent testing allows for better early identification of infants at risk for hearing loss, which may occur before speech and language development. Prevention of hearing loss can be achieved by avoiding the use of antibiotics containing amino glycosides in infants whose mutations make them extremely sensitive to these antibiotics. This information is also useful in genetic counseling, providing region-specific mutation information.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

10647895,"The Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by genetic abnormalities affecting the maternal copy of chromosome region 15q12. Until recently, the molecular diagnosis of AS relied on the detection of either a deletion at 15q11-13, a paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 15 or imprinting mutations. A fourth class of genetic defects underlying AS was recently described and consists of mutations of the UBE3A gene. The vast majority of mutations reported so far are predicted to cause major disruptions at the protein level. It is unclear whether mutations with less drastic consequences for the gene product could lead to milder forms of AS. We report on our results obtained by screening 101 clinically diagnosed AS patients for mutations in the UBE3A gene. Non-stringent clinical criteria were purposely applied for inclusion of AS patients in this study. The mutation search was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and SSCP/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and revealed five novel UBE3A gene mutations as well as three different polymorphisms. All five mutations were detected in patients with typical features of AS and are predicted to cause frameshifts in four cases and the substitution of a highly conserved residue in the fifth. The results we obtained add to the as yet limited number of reports concerning UBE3A gene mutations. Important aspects that emerge from the data available to date is that the four classes of genetic defects known to underlie AS do not appear to cover all cases. The genetic defect underlying approximately 10% of AS cases, including some familial cases, remains unknown.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

We screened the CDH1 gene in 50 cases of bilateral LCIS/ILC using Sanger sequencing and MLPA.
Sanger sequencing revealed four pathogenic germline mutations, including a novel splicing mutation (c.48+1G>A). The remaining three (c.1465insC, c.1942G>T, c.2398delC) have been previously described. All four cases had bilateral LCIS +/- ILC and no family history of gastric cancer.
CDH1 germline mutations have not been previously described in women with LCIS.

A dilative arteriopathy complicated with carotid artery dissection was diagnosed in the third patient, aged 50 years. Two patients are currently being treated with enzyme replacement therapy (alglucosidase alfa), and regular angiographic follow-up showed the absence of progression of vascular abnormalities in one of them.

15720387,"Oxidative stress and imbalance between free radical generation and detoxification may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Mitochondria, carrying the homoplasmic 11778/ND4, 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6 mtDNA point mutations associated with LHON, were used to generate osteosarcoma-derived cybrids. Enhanced mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species has recently been demonstrated in these cybrids [Beretta S, Mattavelli L, Sala G, Tremolizzo L, Schapira AHV, Martinuzzi A, Carelli V & Ferrarese C (2004) Brain 127, 2183-2192]. The aim of this study was to characterize the antioxidant defences of these LHON-affected cells. The activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase, and the amounts of glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured in cybrids cultured both in glucose-rich medium and galactose-rich medium. The latter is known to cause oxidative stress and to trigger apoptotic death in these cells. In spite of reduced SOD activities in all LHON cybrids, and of low GPx and GR activities in cells with the most severe 3460/ND1 and 11778/ND4 mutations, GSH and GSSG content were not significantly modified in LHON cybrids cultured in glucose medium. In contrast, in galactose, GSSG concentrations increased significantly in all cells, indicating severe oxidative stress, whereas GR and MnSOD activities further decreased in all LHON cybrids. These data suggest that, in cells carrying LHON mutations, there is a decrease in antioxidant defences, which is especially evident in cells with mutations associated with the most severe clinical phenotype. This is magnified by stressful conditions such as exposure to galactose.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Pathogenic mutation detection of HCM is having a growing impact on the medical management of patients and their families. However, the remarkable genetic and allelic heterogeneity makes molecular analysis by conventional methods very time-consuming, expensive and difficult to realise in a routine diagnostic molecular laboratory.
The authors used their custom DNA resequencing array which interrogates all possible single-nucleotide variants on both strands of all exons (n=160), splice sites and 5'-untranslated region of 12 HCM genes (27 000 nucleotides). The results for 122 unrelated patients with HCM are presented. Thirty-three known or novel potentially pathogenic heterozygous single-nucleotide variants were identified in 38 patients (31%) in genes MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYL3 and ACTC1.
Although next-generation sequencing will replace all large-scale sequencing platforms for inherited cardiac disorders in the near future, this HCM resequencing array is currently the most rapid, cost-effective and reasonably efficient technology for first-tier mutation screening of HCM in clinical practice.

This T-->C transition at mtDNA position 14709 alters an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide in the region specifying for the anticodon loop of the mitochondrial tRNA(Glu). The nt-14709 mutation was heteroplasmic but present at very high levels in the patient's muscle, white blood cells (WBCs), and hair follicles; lower proportions of mutated mtDNA were observed in WBCs and hair follicles of all examined maternal relatives. In the patient's muscle, abnormal fibers showed mitochondrial proliferation, severe focal defects in cytochrome c oxidase activity, and absence of cross-reacting material for mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides. These fibers had higher levels of mutated mtDNA than did surrounding ""normal"" fibers. Although the percentage of mutated mtDNA in WBCs from family members were distributed around the percentage observed in the mothers, the pattern was different in hair follicles, where the mutated population tended to increase in subsequent generations. PCR/RFLP analysis of single hairs showed that the intercellular variations in the percentage of mutated mtDNA differed among family members, with younger generations having a more homogeneous distribution of mutated mtDNA in different hair follicles. These results suggest that the intercellular distribution of the mutated and wild-type mtDNA populations may drift toward homogeneity in subsequent generations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

This interpretation remains complex and is becoming a growing challenge considering the exponential increase inTP53tests. We developed a functional assay directly performed on patients' blood.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured, activated, exposed to doxorubicin and the p53-mediated transcriptional response was quantified using reverse transcription-multiplex ligation probe amplification and RT-QMPSF assays, including 10 p53 targets selected from transcriptome analysis, and two amplicons to measure p53 mRNA levels. We applied this blood functional assay to 77 patients addressed forTP53analysis.
In 51 wild-typeTP53individuals, the mean p53 functionality score was 12.7 (range 7.5-22.8). Among eight individuals harbouring likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants, the scores were reduced (mean 4.8, range 3.1-7.1), and p53 mRNA levels were reduced in patients harbouring truncating variants. We tested 14 rare unclassified variants (p.(Pro72His), p.(Gly105Asp), p.(Arg110His), p.(Phe134Leu), p.(Arg158Cys), p.(Pro191Arg), p.(Pro278Arg), p.(Arg283Cys), p.(Leu348Ser), p.(Asp352Tyr), p.(Gly108_Phe109delinsVal), p.(Asn131del), p.(Leu265del), c.-117G>T) and 12 yielded functionally abnormal scores. Remarkably, the assay revealed that the c.*1175A>C polymorphic variant withinTP53poly-adenylation site can impact p53 function with the same magnitude as a null variant, when present on both alleles, and may act as a modifying factor in pathogenic variant carriers.
This blood p53 assay should therefore be a useful tool for the rapid clinical classification of germlineTP53variants and detection of non-coding functional variants.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

All of the missense mutations and two other mutations with an unpredictable effect on acid alpha-glucosidase synthesis and function were transiently expressed in COS cells. The effect of a novel splice-site mutation was investigated by real-time PCR analysis.

Here, we report a novel germline DICER1 mutation associated with familial recurrent liver tumors. We then aimed to investigate the contribution of constitutional and somatic DICER1 mutations on HCC occurrence.
We investigated two individuals of a single family that developed recurrent well-differentiated hepatocellular tumors over the years. Histological slides from surgically resected tumors were reviewed. Exome sequencing was performed on constitutional DNA from circulating lymphocytes in both patients. The presence of somatic DICER1 mutations was analyzed in 243 liver tumors. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing was performed in 50 liver tumors to identify groups of tumors with similar profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs).
A pathological study identified hepatocellular adenomas and well-differentiated carcinomas in both patients. Tumors exhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, with strong and diffuse glutamine synthetase expression. Interestingly, non-tumor liver tissues showed abnormal liver zonation as previously reported in Dicer1 knockout mouse livers. Screening for DICER1 mutations in 243 sporadic liver tumors identified six tumors with somatic DICER1 mutations. In HCCs, DICER1 mutations were significantly associated with CTNNB1 mutations (p=0.03). miRNA profiling identified a specific expression profile in DICER1-mutated tumors with a decreased expression of mature miRNAs compared to the other samples. Among the DEMs, downregulation of let-7a and miR-365b was closely related to DICER1 mutations.
Our results highlight the role of DICER1 mutations in liver carcinogenesis in a specific subtype of familial and sporadic hepatocellular carcinomas associated with β-catenin activation.
DICER1 germline mutations are known to predispose individuals to the development of malignant tumors, mainly pleuropulmonary blastoma and ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Here, we described familial HCC associated with a novel DICER1 germline mutation and altered liver zonation.

To determine PAH genotypes, we used PCR-mediated amplification, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing on dried whole blood samples. Where possible, mutation severity was defined according to predicted in vitro PAH enzyme activity estimated by using Cos cell expression analysis for a given mutation. We then asked whether mutation severity, as defined by such expression analysis, correlated with pretreatment PHE levels or with IQ test results. A mutation was identified in 236 (88%) of 267 mutant alleles. Seventeen new mutant alleles were found; A47E, T81P, I102T, E182G, T328D, Y343P, K371R, Y387H, A389E, E422K, IVS9nt5, IVS11nt20, delS70, del364-368/del198-220, delF299, delT323, and -1C/T. In striking contrast to a number of studies in other populations, in this study, based on predicted PAH activity, we observed no correlation between mutation severity and pretreatment PHE levels. There was also no correlation between genotype and IQ. We conclude that in samples collected from an ethnically heterogeneous population, there is no correlation of mutation severity with either pretreatment PHE levels or IQ measurement in treated patients.

However, the precise molecular consequences of PAH causing mutations on the function of the receptor complex remain unclear. We employed novel enzymatic and fluorescence activity based techniques to assess the impact of PAH mutations on pre-mRNA splicing, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and receptor complex interactions. We demonstrate that nonsense and frameshift mutations trigger NMD, providing further evidence that haplo-insufficiency is a major molecular consequence of disease-related BMPR2 mutations. We identified heterogeneous functional defects in BMPR-II activity, including impaired type I receptor phosphorylation, receptor interactions and altered receptor complex stoichiometry leading to perturbation of downstream signalling pathways. Importantly, these studies demonstrate that the intracellular domain of BMPR-II is both necessary and sufficient for receptor complex interaction. Finally and to address the potential for resolution of stoichiometric balance, we investigated an agent that promotes translational readthrough of a BMPR2 nonsense reporter construct without interfering with the NMD pathway. We propose that stoichiometric imbalance, due to either haplo-insufficiency or loss of optimal receptor-receptor interactions impairs BMPR-II mediated signalling in PAH. Taken together, these studies have identified an important target for early therapeutic intervention in familial PAH.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
10332045,"We previously have characterized a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in the tRNAAsn gene. This mutation (G5703A) was associated with a severe mitochondrial protein synthesis defect and a reduction in steady-state levels of tRNAAsn. We now show that, although transmitochondrial cybrids harboring homoplasmic levels of the mutation do not survive in galactose medium, several galactose-resistant clones could be obtained. These cell lines had restored oxidative phosphorylation function and 2-fold higher steady-state levels of tRNAAsn when compared with the parental mutant cell line. The revertant lines contained apparently homoplasmic levels of the mutation and no other detectable alteration in the tRNAAsn gene. To investigate the origin of the suppression, we transferred mtDNA from the revertants (143B/206 TK-) to a different nuclear background (143B/207 TK-, 8AGr). These new transmitochondrial cybrids became defective once again in oxidative phosphorylation and regained galactose sensitivity. However, galactose-resistant clones could also be obtained by growing the 8AGr transmitochondrial cybrids under selection. Because the original rate of reversion was higher than that expected by a classic second site nuclear mutation, and because of the aneuploid features of these cell lines, we searched for the presence of chromosomal alterations that could be associated with the revertant phenotype. These studies, however, did not reveal any gross changes. Our results suggest that modulation of the dosage or expression of unknown nuclear-coded factor(s) can compensate for a pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA gene mutation, suggesting new strategies for therapeutic intervention.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

One hundred and seventy patients with ataxia of unknown etiology referred from clinics throughout the United States and Canada were studied using a targeted exome approach. Patients ranged in age from 2 to 88 years. Analysis was focused on 441 curated genes associated with ataxia and ataxia-like conditions.
Pathogenic and suspected diagnostic variants were identified in 88 of the 170 patients, providing a positive molecular diagnostic rate of 52%. Forty-six different genes were implicated, with the six most commonly mutated genes being SPG7, SYNE1, ADCK3, CACNA1A, ATP1A3, and SPTBN2, which accounted for >40% of the positive cases. In many cases a diagnosis was provided for conditions that were not suspected and resulted in the broadening of the clinical spectrum of several conditions.
Exome sequencing with targeted analysis provides a high-yield approach for the genetic diagnosis of ataxia-related conditions.

Affected individuals from an unrelated family lack this missense mutation, but instead have an alpha/beta cardiac MHC hybrid gene. Identification of two unique mutations within cardiac MHC genes in all individuals with FHC from two unrelated families demonstrates that defects in the cardiac MHC genes can cause this disease.

Six unrelated Chinese families with HCM were studied. For each of the 13 established HCM-susceptibility genes, 3 to 5 microsatellite markers were selected to perform genotyping and haplotype analysis. The linked genes were sequenced.
Haplotype analyses on candidate genetic loci revealed cosegregation of the gene beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) with HCM in a single family. A novel double heterozygous missense mutation of Ala26Val plus Arg719Trp in MYH7 was subsequently identified by sequencing in this family and was associated with a severe phenotype of HCM.

27582386,"The loss of E-cadherin expression in association with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs frequently during tumor metastasis. However, metastases often retain E-cadherin expression, an EMT is not required for metastasis, and metastases can arise from clusters of tumor cells. We demonstrate that the regulation of the adhesive activity of E-cadherin present at the cell surface by an inside-out signaling mechanism is important in cancer. First, we find that the metastasis of an E-cadherin-expressing mammary cell line from the mammary gland to the lung depends on reduced E-cadherin adhesive function. An activating monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin that induces a high adhesive state significantly reduced the number of cells metastasized to the lung without affecting the growth in size of the primary tumor in the mammary gland. Second, we find that many cancer-associated germline missense mutations in the E-cadherin gene in patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer selectively affect the mechanism of inside-out cell surface regulation without inhibiting basic E-cadherin adhesion function. This suggests that genetic deficits in E-cadherin cell surface regulation contribute to cancer progression. Analysis of these mutations also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cadherin regulation at the cell surface.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In all five families, the connexin31 gene ( GJB3 ), located at 1p34 and responsible for non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss in two small Chinese families, has been excluded as the responsible gene. Recently, a fourth member of the KCNQ branch of the K+channel family, KCNQ4, has been cloned. KCNQ4 was mapped to chromosome 1p34 and a single mutation was found in three patients from a small French family with non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss. In this study, we have analysed the KCNQ4 gene for mutations in our five DFNA2 families. Missense mutations altering conserved amino acids were found in three families and an inactivating deletion was present in a fourth family. No KCNQ4 mutation could be found in a single DFNA2 family of Indonesian origin.

We reviewed molecular test results for 70 genes known to cause epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders using next generation sequencing (NGS) and exon-level array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). A positive result was defined as the presence of 1 or 2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in a single gene, depending on the mode of inheritance of the associated disorder.
Overall, 22 genes were found to have a high yield of positive findings by genetic testing, with SCN1A and KCNQ2 accounting for the greatest number of positive findings. In contrast, there were no positive findings in 16 genes. Most of the P/LP variants were sequence changes identified by NGS (90.9%), whereas ~9% were gross deletions or duplications detected by exon-level aCGH. The mean age of molecular diagnosis for the cohort was 5 years, 8 months (ranging from 1 week to 47 years). Recurrent P/LP variants were observed in 14 distinct genes, most commonly in MECP2, KCNQ2, SCN1A, SCN2A, STXBP1, and PRRT2. Parental testing was performed in >30% of positive cases. All variants identified in CDKL5, STXBP1, SCN8A, GABRA1, and FOXG1 were de novo, whereas 85.7% of variants in PRRT2 were inherited.
Using a combined approach of NGS and exon-level aCGH, testing identified a genetic etiology in 15.4% of patients in this cohort and revealed the age at molecular diagnosis for patients.

According to recent estimates, this phenotype may be quite common, suggesting that a large group of individuals may benefit from BH4 substitution, eliminating the need of life-long dietary restrictions. This underscores the importance of identifying BH4-responsive patients in each population, establishing the association with specific PAH mutations. In this work, we describe the results of a pilot study performed with 31 Spanish PAH-deficient patients subjected to a BH4 loading test. Overall, 11/31 (37%) showed a positive response with a 30% decrease in blood Phe levels 8 h after the BH4 challenge, and three additional patients, considered slow responders, showed this decrease only after 12-16 h. We report for the first time a patient homozygous for a splicing mutation with a slow response, suggesting an effect of BH4 supplementation on PAH gene expression. Most of the responsive patients belong to the mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) or mild phenylketonuria phenotypic groups. In MHP patients we report for the first time the results of parallel single Phe doses confirming the utility of these analyses for a better evaluation of the response. Genotype analysis confirms the involvement in the response of specific mutations (D415N, S87R, R176L, E390G, and A309V) present in hemizygous patients, and provide relevant information for the discussion of the potential mechanisms underlying BH4 responsiveness.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The number of glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface was 37% of normal and those receptors displayed a defect in soluble fibrinogen binding. Nevertheless, GTa platelets showed increased adhesion to solid-phase fibrinogen and binding affinity for the RGD-mimetic (3)H-SC52012, a non-peptide GPIIb/IIIa antagonist. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and ADP enhanced the affinity for [(3)H]-SC52012 in normal platelets, but had little effect in GTa platelets. These findings suggested that GTa platelets were locked in an altered affinity state. Genetic analysis showed that GTa was a compound heterozygote for the GPIIIa gene. One allele showed a deletion at the 3' end of exon 3 resulting in a premature stop codon. The second GPIIIa allele had a G to A transition at nucleotide 577, resulting in a Val193Met substitution. HEK 293T cells transfected with mutant GPIIb/IIIaV193M bound [(3)H]-SC52012 with a higher affinity than wild-type GPIIb/IIIa, and this was not increased by DTT.

15342361,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited form of retinal ganglion cell degeneration leading to optic atrophy which is caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Three pathogenic mutations (positions 11778/ND4, 3460/ND1 and 14484/ND6) account for the majority of LHON cases and they affect genes that encode for different subunits of mitochondrial complex I. Excitotoxic injury to retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve has been previously hypothesized, especially given the high susceptibility of this neural cell type to glutamate toxicity. Osteosarcoma-derived cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) generated from six unrelated LHON patients, two cell lines for each pathogenic mutation, were compared with cybrids obtained from three healthy controls. Molecular and biochemical analyses showed that excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1)/GLAST is the most active glutamate transporter in this cellular model. The glutamate uptake maximal velocity was significantly reduced in all LHON cybrids compared with control cybrids. This reduction was correlated in a mutation-specific fashion with the degree of mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, which is enhanced in LHON cybrids. Our findings support the hypothesis that the genetically determined mitochondrial dysfunction in LHON patients leads to impaired activity of the EAAT1 glutamate transporter. This observation is particularly relevant since EAAT1 is the major means of glutamate removal in the inner retina and this prevents retinal ganglion cells being damaged as a result of excitotoxicity.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Recently, pendrin has also been identified in the kidneys, where it is found in the apical plasma membrane of non-α-type intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct. Here, it functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, capable of secreting bicarbonate into the urine. Despite this function, patients with Pendred syndrome have not been reported to develop any significant acid-base disturbances, except a single previous reported case of metabolic alkalosis in the context of Pendred syndrome in a child started on a diuretic.

Her acid-base status and electrolytes were unremarkable when she was well.
This case illustrates that, although pendrin is not usually required to maintain acid-base homeostasis under ambient condition, loss of renal bicarbonate excretion by pendrin during a metabolic alkalotic challenge may contribute to life-threatening acid-base disturbances in patients with Pendred syndrome.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

R241C was the most common mutation (36% of the chromosomes), followed by R408Q (14% of the chromosomes). The remaining mutations were rare and seven mutations have not been reported before: p.F233L (c.697T>C), p.R252Q (c.756G>A), p.E286K (c.856G>A), p.G312V (c.935G>T), p.P314T (c.940C>A), p.I95del (c.284_286delTCA), and p.T81fsX6 (c.241_256del). Both p.R241C and p.R408Q are classified as mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) mutation, which may explain the fact that classical PKU is very rare in Taiwan (n=4, or one in 413,035). This strong founder effect for the p.R241C mutation has been described neither in the Caucasian populations, nor in other reports from Chinese.

The proband is an 11-year-old girl with a negative family history and an apparently healthy younger brother. Since 4 years of age, she has developed a progressive spastic paraparesis associated with ophthalmoparesis and moderate mental retardation. The presence of severe lactic acidosis and Leigh-like lesions of putamina prompted us to perform muscle and skin biopsies. In both, a profound, isolated defect of COX was found by histochemical and biochemical assays. Sequence analysis of muscle mtDNA resulted in the identification of a virtually homoplasmic frameshift mutation in the COIII gene, due to the insertion of an extra C at nucleotide position 9537 of mtDNA. Although the 9537C(ins) does not impair transcription of COIII, no full-length COX III protein was detected in mtDNA translation assays in vivo. Western blot analysis of two-dimensional blue-native electrophoresis showed a reduction of specific crossreacting material and the accumulation of early-assembly intermediates of COX, whereas the fully assembled complex was absent. One of these intermediates had an electrophoretic mobility different from those seen in controls, suggesting the presence of a qualitative abnormality of COX assembly. Immunostaining with specific antibodies failed to detect the presence of several smaller subunits in the complex lacking COX III, in spite of the demonstration that these subunits were present in the crude mitochondrial fraction of patient's cultured fibroblasts. Taken together, the data indicate a role for COX III in the incorporation and maintenance of smaller COX subunits within the complex.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is advantageous for genetic diagnosis of heterogeneous diseases that involve numerous causative genes.
Genomic DNA samples from 58 subjects with hearing loss from 15 unrelated Japanese families were subjected to NGS to identify the genetic causes of hearing loss. Subjects did not have pathogenic GJB2 mutations (the gene most often associated with inherited hearing loss), mitochondrial m.1555A>G or 3243A>G mutations, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, or auditory neuropathy. Clinical features of subjects were obtained from medical records. Genomic DNA was subjected to a custom-designed SureSelect Target Enrichment System to capture coding exons and proximal flanking intronic sequences of 84 genes responsible for nonsyndromic or syndromic hearing loss, and DNA was sequenced by Illumina GAIIx (paired-end read). The sequences were mapped and quality-checked using the programs BWA, Novoalign, Picard, and GATK, and analyzed by Avadis NGS.
Candidate genes were identified in 7 of the 15 families. These genes were ACTG1, DFNA5, POU4F3, SLC26A5, SIX1, MYO7A, CDH23, PCDH15, and USH2A, suggesting that a variety of genes underlie early-childhood hearing loss in Japanese patients.

BH4 therapy began at 10 mg/kg/day and changes were made over time depending on Phe levels. All patients at least doubled their protein ingestion and some could follow a completely free diet. Patients with a smaller decrease in Phe levels during the BH4 overload required higher BH4 doses and/or dietary restrictions to maintain adequate Phe levels over time.

Underrepresented regions were examined by Sanger sequencing. The NGS approach was successfully established using cases with known sequence alterations. Depending on the initial clinical diagnosis, we identified likely causative mutations in 55% of retinitis pigmentosa and 80% of Bardet-Biedl or Usher syndrome cases. Seventy-one novel mutations in 40 genes were newly associated with RD. The genes USH2A, EYS, ABCA4, and RHO were more frequently affected than others. Occasionally, cases carried mutations in more than one RD-associated gene.

CFC is caused by alteration of activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway due to heterogeneous de novo germline mutations in B-Raf mutant proteins, MEK1 and MEK2. Approximately 75% of individuals with CFC have mutations in BRAF. In vitro functional studies demonstrate that many of these mutations confer increase activity upon the mutant protein as compared to the wildtype protein. However, as is seen cancer, some of the B-Raf mutant proteins are kinase impaired. Western blot analyses corroborate kinase assays as determined by mutant proteins phosphorylating downstream effectors MEK and ERK. Approximately 25% of individuals with CFC have mutations in either MEK1 or MEK2 that lead to increased MEK kinase activity as judged by increased phosphorylation of its downstream effector ERK. Unlike BRAF, no somatic mutations have ever been identified in MEK genes. The identification of novel germline BRAF and MEK mutations in CFC will help understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Furthermore, it will also provide insight to the normal function of B-Raf and MEK, and contribute to the knowledge of the role of the MAPK pathway in cancer.

Eight novel mutations were detected. All patients with PDT <30% remained euthyroid to date, although the majority are still under the age of 30.

PTEN function appears to be modulated by subcellular compartmentalization, and mislocalization may affect function. We have shown that cellular ATP levels affect nuclear PTEN levels. Here, we examined the ATP-binding capabilities of PTEN and functional consequences, relevant to cancer-associated mutations. PTEN mutation analysis of CS patients and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and comparative aminoacid analysis were utilized to identify mutations in ATP-binding motifs. The ability of wild-type (WT) or mutant PTEN to bind ATP was assessed by ATP-agarose-binding assays. Subcellular fractionation, western blotting, confocal microscopy and growth assays were used to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization and function. Somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived PTEN missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization. These mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis and anchorage-dependent growth. Examination of PTEN's amino acid sequence revealed these mutations resided in previously undescribed ATP-binding motifs (c.60-73; c.122-136). In contrast to WT PTEN, both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived PTEN missense mutations, which lie within the ATP-binding motifs, result in mutant PTEN that does not bind ATP efficiently. We also show that CS patients with germline ATP-binding motif-mutations had nuclear PTEN mislocalization. Of four unrelated patients with functional germline ATP-binding domain mutations, all three female patients had breast cancers. Germline and somatic mutations within PTEN's ATP-binding domain play important pathogenic roles in both heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by PTEN nuclear mislocalization resulting in altered signaling and growth. Manipulation of ATP may represent novel therapies in tumors with such PTEN alterations.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Study design Fifty-seven unrelated patients with the clinical diagnosis of NS ascertained according to standardized inclusion criteria were prospectively enrolled. Mutational analysis was performed by direct sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the PTPN11 gene.
Sixteen known and 3 novel PTPN11 mutations could be detected in 60% of index patients, in all familial and in 52% of the sporadic cases. Presence of pulmonic stenosis, short stature, easy bruising, and thorax deformities was significantly associated with a PTPN11 mutation, whereas cardiomyopathy was more common in patients without a mutation. On average, PTPN11 mutation-negative probands fulfilled fewer clinical criteria of NS, but more than half-among them all with cardiomyopathy-had the full clinical picture of NS indistinguishable from typical cases with PTPN11 mutation.
The phenotype of NS due to PTPN11 mutations is clinically unambiguous in the majority of patients and represents a highly penetrant trait. Individuals with the clinical diagnosis of NS but without a PTPN11 mutation presumably represent a heterogeneous group in which patients with cardiomyopathy appear to constitute an interesting subgroup for future research.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
22850631,"In hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), CDH1 germline gene alterations are causative events in 30% of the cases. In 20% of HDGC families, CDH1 germline mutations are of the missense type and the mutation carriers constitute a problem in terms of genetic counseling and surveillance. To access the pathogenic relevance of missense mutations, we have previously developed an in vitro method to functionally characterize them. Pathogenic E-cadherin missense mutants fail to aggregate and become more invasive, in comparison with cells expressing the wild-type (WT) protein. Herein, our aim was to develop a complementary method to unravel the pathogenic significance of E-cadherin missense mutations. We used cells stably expressing WT E-cadherin and seven HDGC-associated mutations (five intracellular and two extracellular) and studied by proximity ligation assays (PLA) how these mutants bind to fundamental regulators of E-cadherin function and trafficking. We focused our attention on the interaction with: p120, β-catenin, PIPKIγ and Hakai. We showed that cytoplasmic E-cadherin mutations affect the interaction of one or more binding partners, compromising the E-cadherin stability at the plasma membrane and likely affecting the adhesion complex competence. In the present work, we demonstrated that the study of the interplay between E-cadherin and its binding partners, using PLA, is an easy, rapid, quantitative and highly reproducible technique that can be applied in routine labs to verify the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutants for HDGC diagnosis, especially those located in the intracellular domain of the protein.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Patients with germline CDH1 mutation who underwent multidisciplinary counseling followed by prophylactic total gastrectomy were reviewed.
Ten patients (6 male, 4 female) with a median age of 42 years (range, 26-51) underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy between 2006 and 2009. Of the 6 families represented, there were 4 missense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice site mutation. Median time from genetic testing to surgery was 3 months (range, 1-7). All patients had an upper endoscopy before surgery, identifying only 1 patient with a focus of diffuse gastric cancer. After prophylactic total gastrectomy, extensive pathologic analysis demonstrated that 9 patients had up to 77 foci of noninvasive cancer, and 2 of these patients had 4-12 foci of T1 invasive cancer. Median operative time was 213 minutes; there were no anastomotic leaks, and the length of stay was 7-8 days. One patient had a complication within 30 days (pulmonary embolism), and 3 patients had late complications (2 small bowel obstructions and 1 anastomotic stricture). Median weight loss at 6 months was 19%.

We have analysed 195 PKU patients by DGGE analysis identifying 67 different mutations which represent 89% of the total mutant chromosomes. Seventeen mutations first described in Spain have not yet been detected elsewhere; ten of these are reported here for the first time. The clinical significance of this high genetic heterogeneity was examined by analysing the genotype-phenotype correlations, mainly focusing on the mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (MHP) phenotype. The genotypes found in a group of 93 MHP patients, the largest analysed so far, are described in detail, as well as the relative frequencies of the MHP mutations identified. From the total pool of mutations, 27 can be considered severe, 18 can be defined as mild and 13 as associated with MHP. The prevalent mutations correspond to one severe mutation (IVS10nt-11), one MHP mutation (A403V) and two mild mutations (165T and V388M). The high frequency of mutations with a low degree of severity can explain the relatively higher prevalence of MHP and mild PKU phenotypes in Spain compared with NOrthern European populations. We have looked at the geographical distribution in Spain of the more common mutations, finding evidence of local mutation clustering, which could be the result of differences in the ethnic background and/or of genetic drift within each region.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Do mutations alter myosin's molecular mechanics in a manner that is predictive of the clinical outcome? We have directly characterized the maximal force-generating capacity (F(max)) of two HCM (R403Q, R453C) and two DCM (S532P, F764L) mutant myosins isolated from homozygous mouse models using a novel load-clamped laser trap assay. F(max) was 50% (R403Q) and 80% (R453C) greater for the HCM mutants compared with the wild type, whereas F(max) was severely depressed for one of the DCM mutants (65% S532P). Although F(max) was normal for the F764L DCM mutant, its actin-activated ATPase activity and actin filament velocity (V(actin)) in a motility assay were significantly reduced (Schmitt JP, Debold EP, Ahmad F, Armstrong A, Frederico A, Conner DA, Mende U, Lohse MJ, Warshaw D, Seidman CE, Seidman JG. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103: 14525-14530, 2006.). These F(max) data combined with previous V(actin) measurements suggest that HCM and DCM result from alterations to one or more of myosin's fundamental mechanical properties, with HCM-causing mutations leading to enhanced but DCM-causing mutations leading to depressed function. These mutation-specific changes in mechanical properties must initiate distinct signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the disparate phenotypic responses observed in HCM and DCM.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

We generated WES data for probands and family members and vetted variants through rephenotyping, segregation analyses, and population studies.ResultsThe most common presentation was neurological disease (64%). Seven (9%) probands were diagnosed by CMA. Family WES data were informative for 37 (51%) of the 72 remaining individuals, yielding a specific genetic diagnosis (n = 32) or revealing a novel molecular etiology (n = 5). For five (7%) additional subjects, negative WES decreased the likelihood of genetic disease. Compared to trio analysis, ""family"" WES (average seven exomes per proband) reduced filtered candidate variants from 22 ± 6 to 5 ± 3 per proband. Nineteen (51%) alleles were de novo and 17 (46%) inherited; the latter added to a population-based diagnostic panel.

We recruited 102 phenylketonuric patients on a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet. The initial stage of the protocol was a 24-h BH(4) loading test involving Phe loading and subsequent ingestion of the cofactor, a 50% fall in blood Phe levels being considered a positive response. The non-responders at this stage then completed a one-week therapeutic test combining BH(4) administration and daily protein intake meeting recommended dietary allowances, to assess whether the 24-h test had detected all responders.
The 24-h test detected almost all BH(4) responders (30.3% of the 99 patients included in the analysis), with just two patients (2.0%) subsequently responding positively to the therapeutic test. The 24-h test did not give any false positive results.
The 24-h BH(4) loading test is clinically useful for screening phenylketonuric patients. Specifically, 95% of patients with Phe levels <700 μmol/L, and none with Phe levels >1500 μmol/L were BH(4)-responsive. Given these results, we conclude that patients with Phe levels<700 μmol/L or>1500 μmol/L probably do not need to be tested, prioritising the identification of BH(4)-responsiveness among individuals with intermediate Phe concentrations, between the aforementioned values. Additionally, our results suggest that the therapeutic test only needs to be performed in cases where the reduction in blood Phe levels after cofactor administration is within the range 40%-50%.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Although it is generally acknowledged that the Vikings brought with them Celtic slaves, the relative contribution of these peoples to the modern Icelandic gene pool has been a matter of considerable discussion. Most population genetic studies using classical markers have indicated a large Irish genetic contribution. We have investigated the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in 17 Icelandic patients and found 9 different mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. One novel mutation, Y377fsdelT, accounts for more than 40% of the mutant chromosomes. Haplotype data support a common ancestral origin of the mutation, and genealogical examination extending back more than 5 generations shows that this mutation has probably arisen in an isolated part of southern Iceland and was enriched by a founder effect. At least 7 PKU mutations have originated outside iceland. The almost exclusively Scandinavian background of these mutations and the complete absence of common Irish PKU mutations strongly support historical and linguistic evidence of a predominant Scandinavian heritage of the Icelandic people.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
30809644,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating cardiovascular disorder characterized by the remodelling of pre-capillary pulmonary arteries. The vascular remodelling observed in PAH patients results from excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs). We have previously demonstrated that mutations in the type II receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMPRII) underlie the majority of the familial and inherited forms of the disease. We have further demonstrated that BMPRII deficiency promotes excessive proliferation and attenuates apoptosis in PASMCs, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The major objective of this study is to investigate how BMPRII deficiency impairs apoptosis in PAH. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we demonstrate that deficiency in the expression of BMPRII impairs apoptosis by modulating the alternative splicing of the apoptotic regulator, B-cell lymphoma X (Bcl-x) transcripts: a finding observed in circulating leukocytes and lungs of PAH subjects, hypoxia-induced PAH rat lungs as well as in PASMCs and PAECs. BMPRII deficiency elicits cell specific effects: promoting the expression of Bcl-xL transcripts in PASMCs while inhibiting it in ECs, thus exerting differential apoptotic effects in these cells. The pro-survival effect of BMPRII receptor is mediated through the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) but not the ALK3 receptor. Finally, we show that BMPRII interacts with the ALK1 receptor and pathogenic mutations in the BMPR2 gene abolish this interaction. Taken together, dysfunctional BMPRII responsiveness impairs apoptosis via the BMPRII-ALK1-Bcl-xL pathway in PAH. We suggest Bcl-xL as a potential biomarker and druggable target.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In 125 patients with USH2A mutations, longitudinal regression was used to estimate mean rates of change in Snellen visual acuity, Goldmann visual field area (V4e white test light), and 30-Hz (cone) full-field electroretinogram amplitude. These rates were compared with those of previously studied cohorts with dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to RHO mutations and with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to RPGR mutations. Rates of change in patients with the Cys759Phe mutation, the USH2A mutation associated with nonsyndromic disease, were compared with rates of change in patients with the Glu767fs mutation, the most common USH2A mutation associated with Usher syndrome type II (i.e., retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss).
Mean annual exponential rates of decline for the USH2A patients were 2.6% for visual acuity, 7.0% for visual field area, and 13.2% for electroretinogram amplitude. The rate of acuity loss fell between the corresponding rates for the RHO and RPGR patients, whereas the rates for field and ERG amplitude loss were faster than those for the RHO and RPGR patients. No significant differences were found for patients with the Cys759Phe mutation versus patients with the Glu767fs mutation.
On average, USH2A patients lose visual acuity faster than RHO patients and slower than RPGR patients.

Mutations in the glaucoma gene myocilin (MYOC, GLC1A) are associated with elevated intraocular pressure and the development of autosomal dominant juvenile glaucoma and a subset of adult-onset glaucoma. MYOC is expressed in the trabecular meshwork (TM), a tissue responsible for drainage of aqueous humor from the eye, and the tissue involved in elevated intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. To better understand the role of MYOC in glaucoma pathogenesis, we examined the expression of normal and mutant myocilin in cultured ocular (TM) and non-ocular cells as well as in the aqueous humor of patients with and without MYOC glaucoma. Normal myocilin was secreted from cultured cells, but very little to no myocilin was secreted from cells expressing five different mutant forms of MYOC. In addition, no mutant myocilin was detected in the aqueous humor of patients harboring a nonsense MYOC mutation (Q368X). Co-transfection of cultured cells with normal and mutant myocilin led to suppression of normal myocilin secretion.

The incidence of various PAH variations differs by race and ethnicity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the PAH gene variants of a Han population from Northern China.
In total, 655 PKU patients and their families were recruited for this study; each proband was diagnosed both clinically and biochemically with phenylketonuria. Subjects were sequentially screened for single-base variants and exon deletions or duplications within PAH via direct Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).
A spectrum of 174 distinct PAH variants was identified: 152 previously documented variants and 22 novel variants. While single-base variants were distributed throughout the 13 exons, they were particularly concentrated in exons 7 (33.3%), 11 (14.2%), 6 (13.2%), 12 (11.0%), 3 (10.4%), and 5 (4.4%). The predominant variant was p.Arg243Gln (17.7%), followed by Ex6-96A > G (8.3%), p.Val399 = (6.4%), p.Arg53His (4.7%), p.Tyr356* (4.7%), p.Arg241Cys (4.6%), p.Arg413Pro (4.6%), p.Arg111* (4.4%), and c.442-1G > A (3.4%).

Germ line mutations of TP53 result in cancer proneness syndromes known as Li-Fraumeni, Li-Fraumeni--like, and nonsyndromic predisposition with or without family history. p53 mutants can be classified as partial deficiency alleles or severe deficiency alleles depending on their ability to transactivate a set of human target sequences, as measured using a standardized yeast-based assay (see http://www.umd.be:2072/index.html). We have investigated the extent to which the functional features of p53 mutant alleles determine clinical features in patients who have inherited these alleles and have developed cancer.
We retrieved clinical data from the IARC database (see http://www.p53.iarc.fr/Germline.html) for all cancer patients with germ line p53 mutations and applied stringent statistical evaluations to compare the functional classification of p53 alleles with clinical phenotypes.
Our analyses reveal that partial deficiency alleles are associated with a milder family history (P = 0.007), a lower numbers of tumors (P = 0.007), and a delayed disease onset (median, 31 versus 15 years; P = 0.007) which could be related to distinct tumor spectra.

However, for those delaying surgery or for families with no causative mutation identified, regular endoscopy is advised. This study aimed to determine the yield of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) foci in individuals with a CDH1 pathogenic variant compared with those without and how this varies with successive endoscopies.
Patients fulfilling HDGC criteria were recruited to a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Endoscopy was performed according to a strict protocol with visual inspection followed by focal lesion and random biopsy sampling to detect foci of SRCC. Survival analysis determined progression to finding of SRCC according to CDH1 mutation status. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaires assessed quality of life before surveillance and each endoscopy.
Eighty-five individuals fulfilling HDGC criteria underwent 201 endoscopies; 54 (63.5%) tested positive for CDH1 mutation. SRCC yield was 61.1% in CDH1 mutation carriers compared with 9.7% in noncarriers, and mutation-positive patients had a 10-fold risk of SRCC on endoscopy compared with those with no mutation detected (P < .0005). Yield of SRCC decreased substantially with subsequent endoscopies. Surveillance was associated with improved psychological health.
SRCC foci are prevalent in CDH1 mutation carriers and can be detected at endoscopy using a standardized, multiple biopsy sampling protocol.

Polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis of exon 2 of GPIIb showed polymorphic bands caused by the homozygous deletion of a cytosine at position 288 relative to the translation start site. causing a shifting of the reading frame and appearance of a premature termination codon.

RASopathy-related specifications were applied to 16 ACMG-AMP criteria, with 5 also having adjustable strength with availability of additional evidence. Another 5 criteria were deemed not applicable. Key adjustments to minor allele frequency thresholds, multiple de novo occurrence events and/or segregation, and strength adjustments impacted 60% of variant classifications. Unpublished case-level data from participating laboratories impacted 45% of classifications supporting the need for data sharing.

We have now examined the effect of further human mutations of Cx26 on its sensitivity to CO2: Mutated Cx26 subunits, carrying one of A88S, N14K, N14Y, M34T, or V84L, were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. The CO2-dependence of hemichannel activity, and their ability to exert dominant negative actions on cells stably expressing Cx26WT, was quantified by a dye-loading assay. The KID syndrome mutation, N14K, abolished the sensitivity of Cx26 to CO2Both N14Y and N14K exerted a powerful dominant negative action on the CO2sensitivity of Cx26WTNone of the other mutations (all recessive) had a dominant negative action. A88S shifted the affinity of Cx26 to slightly higher levels without reducing its ability to fully open to CO2M34T did not change the affinity of Cx26 for CO2but reduced its ability to open in response to CO2V84L had no effect on the CO2-sensitivity of Cx26. Some pathological mutations of Cx26 can therefore alter the CO2sensitivity of Cx26 hemichannels. The loss of CO2sensitivity could contribute to pathology and consequent reduced respiratory drive could be an unrecognized comorbidity of these pathologies.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
9886286,"The transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily of cytokines elicit diverse biological responses by interacting with two distinct, but structurally related transmembrane receptor serine kinases (type I and type II). The binding of these dimeric ligands to the type II receptor is the first event in transmembrane signaling for this family. Here we report the 1.5 A resolution crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the type II activin receptor (ActRII-ECD), which reveals a fold similar to that of a class of toxins known as three-finger toxins. This fold is primarily dictated by disulfide bonds formed by eight conserved cysteines, with a characteristic spacing, and thus is likely to be shared by most of the type I and II receptors for the TGFbeta family. Sequence comparison with an evolutionarily distant activin binding-protein identifies several conserved residues, including two hydrophobic clusters that may form binding surfaces for activin and the type I receptor.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
28235946,"Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is an adhesion molecule assigned to the activated endothelium mediating immune cells adhesion and extravasation. However, its expression in renal carcinomas inversely correlates with tumor malignancy. Our experiments in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines demonstrated that von Hippel Lindau (VHL) loss, hypoxia, or PHD (for prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins) inactivation decreased VCAM-1 levels through a transcriptional mechanism that was independent of the hypoxia-inducible factor and dependent on the nuclear factor κB signaling pathway. Conversely, VHL expression leads to high VCAM-1 levels in ccRCC, which in turn leads to better outcomes, possibly by favoring antitumor immunity through VCAM-1 interaction with the α4β1 integrin expressed in immune cells. Remarkably, in ccRCC human samples with VHL nonmissense mutations, we observed a negative correlation between VCAM-1 levels and ccRCC stage, microvascular invasion, and symptom presentation, pointing out the clinical value of VCAM-1 levels as a marker of ccRCC progression.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
31797984,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family that control embryonic patterning, as well as tissue development and homeostasis. Loss of function mutations in the type II BMP receptor BMPR2 are the leading cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disease of vascular occlusion that leads to high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. To understand the structural consequences of these mutations, we determined the crystal structure of the human wild-type BMPR2 kinase domain at 2.35 Å resolution. The structure revealed an active conformation of the catalytic domain that formed canonical interactions with the bound ligand Mg-ADP. Disease-associated missense mutations were mapped throughout the protein structure, but clustered predominantly in the larger kinase C-lobe. Modelling revealed that the mutations will destabilize the protein structure by varying extents consistent with their previously reported functional heterogeneity. The most severe mutations introduced steric clashes in the hydrophobic protein core, whereas those found on the protein surface were less destabilizing and potentially most favorable for therapeutic rescue strategies currently under clinical investigation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
29478817,"Creatine transporter is currently the focus of renewed interest with emerging roles in brain neurotransmission and physiology, and the bioenergetics of cancer metastases. We here report on amendments of a standard creatine uptake assay which might help clinical chemistry laboratories to extend their current range of measurements of creatine and metabolites in body fluids to functional enzyme explorations. In this respect, short incubation times and the use of a stable-isotope-labeled substrate (D3-creatine) preceded by a creatine wash-out step from cultured fibroblast cells by removal of fetal bovine serum (rich in creatine) from the incubation medium are recommended. Together, these measures decreased, by a first order of magnitude, creatine concentrations in the incubation medium at the start of creatine-uptake studies and allowed to functionally discriminate between 4 hemizygous male and 4 heterozygous female patients with X-linked SLC6A8 deficiency, and between this cohort of eight patients and controls. The functional assay corroborated genetic diagnosis of SLC6A8 deficiency. Gene anomalies in our small cohort included splicing site (c.912G > A [p.Ile260_Gln304del], c.778-2A > G and c.1495 + 2 T > G), substitution (c.407C > T) [p.Ala136Val] and deletion (c.635_636delAG [p.Glu212Valfs*84] and c.1324delC [p.Gln442Lysfs*21]) variants with reduced creatine transporter function validating their pathogenicity, including that of a previously unreported c.1324delC variant. The present assay adaptations provide an easy, reliable and discriminative manner for exploring creatine transporter activity and disease variations. It might apply to drug testing or other evaluations in the genetic and metabolic horizons covered by the emerging functions of creatine and its transporter, in a way, however, requiring and completed by additional studies on female patients and blood-brain barrier permeability properties of selected compounds. As a whole, the proposed assay of creatine transporter positively adds to currently existing measurements of this transporter activity, and determining on a large scale the extent of its exact suitability to detect female patients should condition in the future its transfer in clinical practice.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
12352684,"The gene of the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) was found to be the main causative gene of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB1). Although 35delG has been known as the major mutation in Western countries, 235delC was reported to be a specific form of mutation in Asian populations. The objective of the study was to identify how 235delC and E114G changes found in the Korean population affected the function of using molecular biological techniques.
Genes containing 235delC and E114G were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and HeLa cells were transfected with the recombinant DNA samples by the liposome complex method. The expression and subcellular localization of Cx26 were determined, using antibodies against amino acid sequences in the intracellular loop (IL) and N-terminal (NT) portions of Cx26. To analyze functions of the as a gap junction channel, we examined Lucifer yellow dye transfer between cells with a scrape-loaded technique. Wild-type (WT) with normal hearing was used as a positive control, and mock transfected cells were used as a negative control.
Immunocytochemical analysis showed that cells transfected with E114G and WT gave characteristic punctate patterns of reaction in the cell membrane with both antibodies. However, 235delC cells were not stained with anti-IL antibody but stained slightly just around the nucleus only with anti-NT antibody. In a functional study of, transfer of Lucifer yellow into contiguous cells was detected in both WT and E114G, but no transfer activity was observed in 235delC.
The 235delC mutation showed a loss of targeting activity to the cell membrane and severe deterioration of gap junction activity. For the E114G, we did not find any difference from WT transfected cells.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The entire coding region of the PAH gene was analyzed with dHPLC to select the samples where subsequently the automated sequencing analysis was performed. MLPA analysis was performed to identify large deletions, which were later confirmed with long-range PCR. Correlations with patients' phenotypes and genotype-based predictions of BH(4)-responsiveness were assessed. Altogether, disease-causing mutations were identified on 209 alleles (detection rate 97.7%). A spectrum of 36 different disease-causing mutations was identified: 20 missense mutations (80% of the alleles), eight splicing mutations (13% of the alleles), one nonsense mutation (0.5% of the alleles), four small deletions with frame shift (6% of the alleles), one small insertion with frame shift (0.5% of the alleles), and two large deletions (2% of the alleles). The most frequent mutation was p.R408W in exon 12, representing 29% of the alleles, which is in concordance with other neighboring and/or Slavic PKU populations. Other common mutations were: p.R158Q, p.A403V, p.P281L and p.E390G, accounting for 9%, 7%, 7% and 7% of the alleles respectively. Five novel mutations were detected: c.43_44insAG, c.56_59+1delACAGG, p.V45A, p.L62P and p.R157S. Large deletion of exon 5 (EX5del955) was found in three patients and a deletion of exon 3 (EX3del4765) in one patient. A spectrum of 64 different genotypes was found, seven of them accounting for over than a third of all families. Among thirteen families with homozygous mutation (13% of the PKU population), 10 had p.R408W, two had p.R158Q and one had p.E390G. Among 107 families, 58 were classified as classic PKU (54.2%), 28 as mild PKU (25.9%) and 21 as MHP (19.6%).

10545602,"Glaucoma is a blinding eye disease that affects approximately 70 000 000 people world-wide. Mutations in the gene TIGR / MYOC have been shown to cause the most common form of the disease, primary open angle glaucoma, in selected families. Amino acid sequence variants of the gene have been found in 2-4% of sporadic primary open angle glaucoma cases. Most variants are rare and it is often difficult to definitively distinguish between a deleterious mutation and a benign variant solely on the basis of relative frequencies in patient and control groups. The function of the TIGR/myocilin protein is unknown and an assay to functionally classify variants is lacking. We sought to develop a biochemical assay to distinguish different forms of TIGR/myocilin. We investigated the Triton X-100 detergent solubility characteristics of mutant and normal forms of the protein, expressed by transfection in cultured cells. We observed a clear difference in the behavior of the two types of TIGR/myocilin; all confirmed mutant proteins tested were substantially Triton insoluble, while normal protein and controls were completely soluble. We also tested seven ambiguous variant proteins and classified them as mutant or normal on the basis of their Triton solubility. The results in some cases validated, and in other cases contradicted, earlier classifications of these variants. To our knowledge, Triton solubility is the first example of a general difference in the properties of mutant and normal forms of TIGR/myocilin. The assay we have developed will be useful for discerning protein functional information from the location of mutations, will aid genetic counseling of individuals with TIGR/myocilin variants and may provide a clue to understanding a mechanism by which mutations in TIGR / MYOC cause glaucoma.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%.

12505163,"Connexins are the protein subunits of gap junction channels that allow a direct signaling pathway between networks of cells. The specific role of connexin channels in the homeostasis of different organs has been validated by the association of mutations in several human connexins with a variety of genetic diseases. Several connexins are present in the mammalian cochlea and at least four of them have been proposed as genes causing sensorineural hearing loss. We have started our functional analysis by selecting nine mutations in Cx26 that are associated with non-syndromic recessive deafness (DFNB1). We have observed that both human Cx26 wild-type (HCx26wt) and the F83L polymorphism, found in unaffected controls, generated electrical conductance between paired Xenopus oocytes, which was several orders of magnitude greater than that measured in water-injected controls. In contrast, most recessive Cx26 mutations (identified in DFNB1 patients) resulted in a simple loss of channel activity. In addition, the V37I mutation, originally identified as a polymorphism in heterozygous unaffected individuals, was devoid of function and thus may be pathologically significant. Unexpectedly, we have found that the recessive mutation V84L retained functional activity in both paired Xenopus oocytes and transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, both the magnitude of macroscopic junctional conductance and its voltage-gating properties were indistinguishable from those of HCx26wt. The identification of functional differences of disease causing mutations may lead to define which permeation or gating properties of Cx26 are necessary for normal auditory function in humans and will be instrumental in identifying the molecular steps leading to DFNB1.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
30732632,"The RASopathies are a class of developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been frequently described in children with RASopathy, but only a minority of patients have received formal genotyping. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic basis and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with RASopathy-associated HCM.
We retrospectively reviewed the mutation spectrum and clinical outcome of all the patients with RASopathy derived from 168 pediatric HCM cases referred to our institution between January 2012 and July 2018.
A heterozygous missense mutation in one of known RASopathy genes was identified in 46 unrelated children with HCM. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene were the most prevalent (19/46); this was followed by mutations in RAF1 (11/46), KRAS (5/46), RIT1 (4/46), BRAF (3/46), SOS1 (2/46), HRAS (1/46), and SHOC2 (1/46). Moreover, two compound heterozygous missense mutations in the LZTR1 gene were identified in one patient with the Noonan syndrome phenotype and HCM. The median age at the diagnosis of HCM was 3.0 months (range 0 months to 8.1 years). Twenty-one of the patients had significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and 32 had concomitant congenital heart disease. Three patients with a mutation in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene died of cardiac failure at the ages of 3.0, 3.5, and 6.0 months. The remaining 44 patients were alive after an average follow-up time of 3.9 years (0.5 to 17.1 years, median 2.9 years) from the initial diagnosis of HCM, including 5 patients with spontaneous regression of their cardiac hypertrophy.
RASopathy-associated HCM is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by early-onset cardiac hypertrophy and a high prevalence of co-existing congenital heart disease, which is most frequently related to specific mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Rapidly progressive HCM, resulting in an early death, is uncommon in RASopathy patients except those with specific mutations in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
7556322,"Mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) cause persistent hyperphenylalaninaemia. To date, more than 200 point mutations and microdeletions have been characterized. Each mutation has a particular quantitative effect on enzyme activity and recessive expression of different mutant alleles results in a marked interindividual heterogeneity of metabolic and clinical phenotypes. In this paper we demonstrate how a simple clinical test can be used to evaluate the correlation between mutation genotype and phenylalanine metabolism. In hyperphenylalaninaemic patients with known PAH mutation genotype, we have investigated phenylalanine turnover in vivo by measuring the ability to eliminate a test dose of L-phenylalanine. All patients could be considered functionally hemizygous for one of their mutant alleles by carrying on the other allele a mutation that is known to completely abolish PAH activity and encode a peptide with no immunoreactivity. Seven mutations (R408W, IVS-12nt1, R261Q, G46S, Y414C, A104D, and D415N) were characterized by oral phenylalanine loading, each mutation being represented by at least three patients. The elimination profile determined for a 3-day period provides a measure to compare residual activity of the mutant proteins and to assign each mutation to a particular metabolic phenotype. The established relation between genotype and phenotype may enable prediction of the severity of the disease by genotype determination in the newborn period. This will aid in the management of hyperphenylalaninaemia and may improve prognosis.
The possibility of predicting the residual enzyme activity by DNA analysis performed already in the newborn period allows the prompt implementation of a diet that is adjusted to the degree of PAH deficiency. This may improve management and prognosis of hyperphenylalaninaemia.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

26846855,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare familial cancer predisposition syndrome caused by a loss or mutation in a single gene,VHL, but it exhibits a wide phenotypic variability that can be categorized into distinct subtypes. The phenotypic variability has been largely argued to be attributable to the extent of deregulation of the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor α, a well established target of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, ECV (Elongins/Cul2/VHL). Here, we show that erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is hydroxylated on proline 419 and 426 via prolyl hydroxylase 3. EPOR hydroxylation is required for binding to the β domain of VHL and polyubiquitylation via ECV, leading to increased EPOR turnover. In addition, several type-specific VHL disease-causing mutants, including those that have retained proper binding and regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor α, showed a severe defect in binding prolyl hydroxylated EPOR peptides. These results identify EPOR as the secondbona fidehydroxylation-dependent substrate of VHL that potentially influences oxygen homeostasis and contributes to the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

All seven autism-associated PTEN mutants investigated retained the ability to suppress cellular AKT signalling, although five were highly unstable. Observed effects on AKT also correlated with the ability to suppress soma size and the length and density of dendritic spines in primary neurons.

We here present two families, one affected by CS and the other affected by BRRS, both carriers of specific pathogenetic missense mutation in exon 5 of PTEN gene, within the catalitic domain. Both PHTS families exhibited extremely variable phenotypes, showing inter- and intra- familial variability. One of the two characterised mutations, the c.320A- > T; p.107Asp- > Val, identified in the CS family, was not previously described in the literature. Furthermore, the BRRS family, carrier of the c.406 T- > C; p.136Cys- > Arg mutation, shows a substantial alteration of PTEN protein expression that well correlates with intra-familial phenotypic variability. Finally, we describe an apparently sporadic case of an 80-year-old man, with a very low level of PTEN mRNA and protein expression, both in healthy and tumour colon mucosa, associated with a very atypical phenotype. He developed a metastatic colorectal carcinoma, macrocephaly and pheochromocytoma. According to literature data, our observations confirm that PTEN mutations of catalytic domain can cause different syndromes.

22841515,"A need exists to expand the characterization of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) responsiveness in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), beyond simply evaluating change in blood phenylalanine concentrations. The clinical interpretation of BH(4) responsiveness should be evaluated within the context of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype.
This investigation seeks to use a modified version of a previously developed PAH genotype severity tool, the assigned value (AV) sum, to assess the molecular basis of responsiveness in a clinical cohort and to explore the tool's ability to differentiate BH(4) responsive groups.
BH(4) response was previously clinically classified in 58 patients with PKU, with three response groups emerging: definitive responders, provisional responders, and non-responders. Provisional responders represented a clinically ambiguous group, with an initial decrease in plasma phenylalanine concentrations, but limited ability to improve dietary phenylalanine tolerance. In this retrospective analysis, mutations in the PAH gene were identified in each patient. PAH genotype was characterized through the AV sum approach, in which each mutation is given an AV of 1, 2, 4, or 8; the sum of both mutations' AV corresponds to genotype severity, with a lower number representing a more severe phenotype. An AV sum cutoff of 2 (indicative of the most severe genotypes) was used to dichotomize patients and predict BH(4) responsiveness. Provisional responders were classified with the definitive responders then the non-responders to see with which group they best aligned.
In 17/19 definitive responders, at least one mutation was mild or moderate in severity (AV sum>2). In contrast, 7/9 provisional responders carried two severe or null mutations (AV sum=2), suggesting little molecular basis for responsiveness. Non-responders represent a heterogeneous group with 15/25 patients carrying two severe mutations (AV sum=2), 5/25 patients carrying one moderate or mild mutation in combination with a severe or null mutation (AV sum>2), and the remaining five patients carrying an uncharacterized mutation in combination with a severe mutation. Predictive sensitivity of the AV sum was maximized (89.5% vs. 67.9%) with limited detriment to specificity (79.4% vs. 80.0%), by classifying provisional responders with the non-responders rather than with the definitive responders.
In our clinical cohort, the AV sum tool was able to identify definitive responders with a high degree of sensitivity. As demonstrated by both the provisional responder group and the substantial number of non-responders with AV sums>2, a potential exists for misclassification when BH(4) response is determined by relying solely on change in plasma phenylalanine concentrations.

An additional four subjects with possible Noonan syndrome were evaluated, but no mutations in PTPN11/SHP2 were identified. These results confirm that mutations in PTPN11/SHP2 underlie a common form of Noonan syndrome, and that the disease exhibits both allelic and locus heterogeneity.

Assigning a syndromic diagnosis is important because it guides management, especially surveillance and prophylactic surgery.
To systematically classify patients with unexplained hamartomatous or hyperplastic/mixed polyposis by extensive molecular analysis in the context of central rereview of histopathology results.
Prospective, referral-based study of 49 unrelated patients from outside institutions (n = 28) and at a comprehensive cancer center (n = 21), conducted from May 2, 2002, until December 15, 2004. Germline analysis of PTEN, BMPR1A, STK11 (sequence, deletion), SMAD4, and ENG (sequence), specific exon screening of BRAF, MYH, and BHD, and rereview of polyp histology results were performed.
Molecular, clinical, and histopathological findings in patients with unexplained polyposis.
Of the 49 patients, 11 (22%) had germline mutations. Of 14 patients with juvenile polyposis, 2 with early-onset disease had mutations in ENG, encoding endoglin, previously only associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; 1 had hemizygous deletion encompassing PTEN and BMPR1A; and 1 had an SMAD4 mutation. One individual previously classified with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome had a PTEN deletion. Among 9 individuals with an unknown hamartomatous polyposis, 4 had mutations in STK11 (1), BMPR1A (2), and SMAD4 (1). Of the 23 patients with hyperplastic/mixed polyposis, 2 had PTEN mutations. Substantial discrepancies in histopathology results were seen.
Systematic molecular classification of 49 patients with unexplained hamartomatous or hyperplastic polyposis uncovered a potential novel susceptibility gene, ENG, for juvenile polyposis. Importantly, given the substantial proportion of patients found to have germline mutations, more extensive analysis of the known susceptibility genes is indicated. Rereview of histology results by a dedicated gastrointestinal pathologist should be considered routinely, as organ-specific surveillance rests on defining syndromic diagnosis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify pathogenic variants in patients that exhibited NS-related phenotypes. We assessed the facial features and clinical manifestations of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Gene-related Chinese NS facial features were described using artificial intelligence (AI).NGS identified pathogenic variants in 103 Chinese patients in eight NS-related genes: PTPN11 (48.5%), SOS1 (12.6%), SHOC2 (11.7%), KRAS (9.71%), RAF1 (7.77%), RIT1 (6.8%), CBL (0.97%), NRAS (0.97%), and LZTR1 (0.97%). Gene-related facial representations showed that each gene was associated with different facial details. Eight novel pathogenic variants were detected and clinical features because of specific genetic variants were reported, including hearing loss, cancer risk due to a PTPN11 pathogenic variant, and ubiquitous abnormal intracranial structure due to SHOC2 pathogenic variants.

10389854,"Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, give rise to early-onset type 2 diabetes (MODY1). The functional properties of mutant HNF-4alpha proteins and the molecular mechanisms by which they impair insulin secretion are largely unknown. In the present study, we have investigated transcriptional activation, DNA binding properties, and protein dimerization activity of three HNF-4alpha missense mutations--HNF4(R127W), HNF4(V255M), and HNF4(E276Q)--that have been associated with type 2 diabetes. We demonstrate that HNF4(E276Q) has lost its ability to bind to HNF-4 consensus binding sites and activate transcription. HNF4(E276Q) had no effect on the functional activity of wild-type HNF-4alpha in the pancreatic beta-cell line HIT-T15, but it exhibited weak dominant-negative activity in other cell types. Analysis of HNF4(E276Q) protein showed that it exists in two forms: a full length 54-kDa protein and a 40-kDa COOH-terminal protein lacking the NH2-terminal transactivation domain and the DNA binding domain. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that this truncated protein can bind to wild-type HNF-4alpha and may be responsible for the weak dominant-negative effects seen in these cells. In addition, we show that the transcriptional transactivation of HNF4(R127W) and HNF4(V255M) is indistinguishable from that of wild-type HNF-4alpha, suggesting that they are sequence polymorphisms. Our results demonstrate that HNF4(E276Q) is a loss-of-function mutation and that it identifies glutamic acid 276 in alpha-helix 8 of the ligand-binding domain of HNF-4alpha protein as a critical residue for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and protein stability in vivo.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

This study identified and expressed 2 additional mutations in this region, a homozygous defect in a patient with vWD type 3 (C2754W) and a heterozygous frameshift mutation (8566delC) in a patient with vWD type 2A, subtype IIE. Both mutations involve cysteine residues that we propose are possibly essential for dimerization. To prove this hypothesis, transient recombinant expression of each of the 2 mutations introduced in the carboxy-terminal vWF fragment II and in the complete vWF complementary DNA, respectively, were carried out in COS-7 cells and compared with expression of vWD 2A/IID mutation C2773R and the wild-type (WT) sequence in COS-7 cells. Recombinant WT vWF fragment II assembled correctly into a dimer, whereas recombinant mutant fragments were monomeric. Homozygous expression of recombinant mutant full-length vWF resulted in additional dimers, probably through disulfide bonding at the amino-terminal multimerization site, whereas recombinant WT vWF correctly assembled into multimers. Coexpression of recombinant mutant and recombinant WT vWF reproduced the multimer patterns observed in heterozygous individuals. Our results suggest that a common defect of vWF biosynthesis--lack of vWF dimerization--may cause diverse types and subtypes of vWD. We also confirmed previous studies that found that disulfide bonding at the vWF amino-terminal is independent of dimerization at the vWF carboxy-terminal.

Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas, malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours. In addition, PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes: Cowden disease (CD; MIM 158350) and Bannayan-Zonana (BZS) or Ruvalcaba-Riley-Smith syndrome (MIM 153480). Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations. PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 (81%) CD families, including missense and nonsense point mutations, deletions, insertions, a deletion/insertion and splice site mutations. These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN , with the exception of the first, fourth and last exons. A 'hot spot' for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif, with 13 of 30 (43%) CD mutations identified in this exon. Seven of 30 (23%) were within the core motif, the majority (five of seven) of which were missense mutations, possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region. Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven (57%) BZS families studied. Interestingly, none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif. It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation, R233X, was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family. Genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families. However, genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses. The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease. A correlation was observed between the presence/absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement (unaffected versus benign versus malignant). Specifically and more directly, an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease. Secondly, there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif, the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations, and the involvement of all major organ systems (central nervous system, thyroid, breast, skin and gastrointestinal tract).

Two protein isoforms have been identified: a short isoform of 1,546 amino acids and a more recently recognized isoform extending to 5,202 amino acids. We have screened the full length by genomic sequencing. We confirm that many mutations occur in the exons contributing solely to the longer form. USH2 is an autosomal recessive disorder and, in contrast to previous studies, both mutations were identified in 23 patients and a single mutation in 2 out of 33 patients. A total of 34 distinct mutated alleles were identified, including one complex allele with three variants and another with two. A total of 27 of these are novel, confirming that most mutations in usherin are private. Many of the mutations will lead to prematurely truncated protein but as there are a substantial number of missense variants, we have used in silico analysis to assess their pathogenicity. Evidence that they are disease-causing has been produced by protein alignments and three-dimensional (3D) structural predictions when possible.

The present study examined molecular and phenotypic characteristics of individuals with germline heterozygous PTEN mutations and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (PTEN-ASD), with the aim of identifying pathophysiologic markers that specifically associate with PTEN-ASD and that may serve as targets for future treatment trials. PTEN-ASD patients (n=17) were compared with idiopathic (non-PTEN) ASD patients with (macro-ASD, n=16) and without macrocephaly (normo-ASD, n=38) and healthy controls (n=14). Group differences were evaluated for PTEN pathway protein expression levels, global and regional structural brain volumes and cortical thickness measures, neurocognition and adaptive behavior. RNA expression patterns and brain characteristics of a murine model of Pten mislocalization were used to further evaluate abnormalities observed in human PTEN-ASD patients. PTEN-ASD had a high proportion of missense mutations and showed reduced PTEN protein levels. Compared with the other groups, prominent white-matter and cognitive abnormalities were specifically associated with PTEN-ASD patients, with strong reductions in processing speed and working memory. White-matter abnormalities mediated the relationship between PTEN protein reductions and reduced cognitive ability. The Pten(m3m4) murine model had differential expression of genes related to myelination and increased corpus callosum. Processing speed and working memory deficits and white-matter abnormalities may serve as useful features that signal clinicians that PTEN is etiologic and prompting referral to genetic professionals for gene testing, genetic counseling and cancer risk management; and could reveal treatment targets in trials of treatments for PTEN-ASD.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) are the most common cause of HCM. This study was to reveal the disease-causing gene mutations in Chinese population with HCM, and to analyze the correlation between the genotype and phenotype.
The exons 3 to 26 of MYH7 were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were sequenced in five non-kin HCM patients. A 17-year-old patient was detected to be an Arg723Gly mutation carrier. Then his family was gene-screened, and the correlation between genotype and phenotype was analyzed.
The mutation of Arg723Gly in a Chinese family with HCM was detected for the first time. With a C-G transversion in nucleotide 13,619 of the MYH7 gene, located at the essential light chain interacting region in S1, the replacement of arginine by glycine took place at amino acid residue 723. A two-dimensional echocardiogram showed moderate asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with left atria enlargement. There was no obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract. In his family, a total of 13 individuals were diagnosed HCM and 5 of them were dead of congestive heart failure at a mean age of 66-year-old. Eight living members were all detected to carry the mutation, in which 3 developed progressive heart failure. Moreover, the heart function of the people evidently deteriorates when their age are older than 50. The mutation and the disease show co-separated.

25110572,"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a rare genetic muscle disorder, but one of the most common among the congenital myopathies. NM is caused by mutations in at least nine genes: Nebulin (NEB), α-actin (ACTA1), α-tropomyosin (TPM3), β-tropomyosin (TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), cofilin-2 (CFL2), Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain-containing 13 (KBTBD13), and Kelch-like family members 40 and 41 (KLHL40 and KLHL41). Nebulin is a giant (600 to 900 kDa) filamentous protein constituting part of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Around 90% of the primary structure of nebulin is composed of approximately 35-residue α-helical domains, which form super repeats that bind actin with high affinity. Each super repeat has been proposed to harbor one tropomyosin-binding site.
We produced four wild-type (WT) nebulin super repeats (S9, S14, S18, and S22), 283 to 347 amino acids long, and five corresponding repeats with a patient mutation included: three missense mutations (p.Glu2431Lys, p.Ser6366Ile, and p.Thr7382Pro) and two in-frame deletions (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del and p.Val3924_Asn3929del). We performed F-actin and tropomyosin-binding experiments for the nebulin super repeats, using co-sedimentation and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) pull-down assays. We also used the GST pull-down assay to test the affinity of WT nebulin super repeats for WT α- and β-tropomyosin, and for β-tropomyosin with six patient mutations: p.Lys7del, p.Glu41Lys, p.Lys49del, p.Glu117Lys, p.Glu139del and p.Gln147Pro.
WT nebulin was shown to interact with actin and tropomyosin. Both the nebulin super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation and nebulin super repeats lacking exon 55 (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del) showed weak affinity for F-actin compared with WT fragments. Super repeats containing the p.Ser6366Ile mutation showed strong affinity for actin. When tested for tropomyosin affinity, super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation showed stronger binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin, and the super repeat containing the p.Thr7382Pro mutation showed weaker binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin. Super repeats containing the deletion p.Val3924_Asn3929del showed similar affinity for actin and tropomyosin as that seen with WT super repeats. Of the tropomyosin mutations, only p.Glu41Lys showed weaker affinity for nebulin (super repeat 18).

In this study we performed multiplex targeted sequencing of 10 genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway on brain tissue from 33 children who underwent surgical resection of dysplastic cortex for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Sequencing results were correlated with clinical, imaging, pathological and immunohistological phenotypes. We identified mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA and AKT3 in this cohort, including cancer-associated hotspot PIK3CA mutations in dysplastic megalencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia type IIa. In addition, a germline PTEN mutation was identified in a male with hemimegalencephaly but no peripheral manifestations of the PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome. A spectrum of clinical, imaging and pathological abnormalities was found in this cohort. While patients with more severe brain imaging abnormalities and systemic manifestations were more likely to have detected mutations, routine histopathological studies did not predict mutation status. In addition, elevated levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein were identified in both neurons and astrocytes of all hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia type II specimens, regardless of the presence or absence of detected PI3K/AKT pathway mutations. In contrast, expression patterns of the T308 and S473 phosphorylated forms of AKT and in vitro AKT kinase activities discriminated between mutation-positive dysplasia cortex, mutation-negative dysplasia cortex, and non-dysplasia epilepsy cortex.

Radiographic studies showed that 12/14 (86%) were fast-flow vascular anomalies, and angiography typically showed focal segmental dilatation of draining veins. Excessive ectopic fat in the vascular anomalies was present in 11/12 (92%) of patients on CT or MRI. Intracranial developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) were found in 8/9 (89%) of patients who had brain MRI with contrast.

Indications for testing were either confirmation of diagnosis and prediction of disease severity, or carrier analysis. Each year there were several laboratories that failed to identify mutations because of methodological limitations. Of the participating laboratories that used comprehensive mutation detection methods, each year there was at least one that missed at least one mutation. Indeed, in the 2007 scheme almost 8% of reports from laboratories that used comprehensive mutation detection methods such as sequencing of all exons of the PAH gene contained incorrect genotypes. There were also serious deficiencies in the interpretation of genotype data: in the 2007 scheme, 6 out of 10 laboratories that obtained full genotyping marks for interpretation incurred a reduction of marks because information on the expected phenotype was missing or wrong. Several laboratories failed to appreciate the clinical relevance of a mutation associated with mild hyperphenylalaninaemia, which does not require treatment, and some discussed the option of prenatal diagnosis in the respective case.

In the following study, we report the molecular findings for 693 unrelated patients that sequentially received Sanger sequence analysis of ACADVL as a result of a positive NBS for VLCADD. Highlighting the variable molecular underpinnings of this disorder, we identified 94 different pathogenic ACADVL variants (40 novel), as well as 134 variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs). Evidence for the pathogenicity of a subset of recurrent VUSs was provided using multiple in silico analyses. Surprisingly, the most frequent finding in our cohort was carrier status, 57% all individuals had a single pathogenic variant or VUS. This result was further supported by follow-up array and/or acylcarnitine analysis that failed to provide evidence of a second pathogenic allele. Notably, exon-targeted array analysis of 131 individuals screen positive for VLCADD failed to identify copy number changes in ACADVL thus suggesting this test has a low yield in the setting of NBS follow-up. While no genotype was common, the c.848T>C (p.V283A) pathogenic variant was clearly the most frequent; at least one copy was found in ~10% of all individuals with a positive NBS. Clinical and biochemical data for seven unrelated patients homozygous for the p.V283A allele suggests that it results in a mild phenotype that responds well to standard treatment, but hypoglycemia can occur.

Most responsive patients were affected by mild HPA (77%), a smaller percentage by mild (7%) and moderate (7%) phenylketonuria (PKU). One patient with classical PKU was responsive to BH4. Eighteen mutations were found to be associated to the BH4-responsive phenotype.
BH4-responsiveness is shown by a consistent number of PAH-deficient hyperphenylalaninemic patients and seems to be common in milder phenotypes. Genotype is not the only factor determining BH4-responsiveness.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
15543332,"In this study, we report on the characterization of a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT). Immunochemical analysis on platelets from the patient showed that the expression of alpha IIb beta 3 was only 25% of that in normal healthy controls, suggesting a case of GT. Functional analysis revealed a total lack of fibrinogen binding capacity. Molecular genetic analysis of the full-length cDNA sequences of alpha IIb and beta 3 subunits showed a novel point mutation C621T in alpha IIb cDNA, leading to a missense substitution of threonine for isoleucine at position 176. Coexpression of normal beta 3 and mutant alpha IIb(1176) isoform in mammalian cells showed a marked reduction in the expression of alpha IIb beta 3 heterodimer when compared to the wild-type and a decreased intracellular level of alpha IIb. The T176 I mutation is located in the N-terminal region in the W3:1-2 connecting strand of the beta-propeller. These data suggest that the N-terminal alpha IIb domain plays an important structural role in the formation of heterodimer and that it is also involved in fibrinogen binding.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
8282798,"Three novel beta cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene missense mutations, Phe513Cys, Gly716Arg, and Arg719Trp, which cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) are described. One mutation in exon 15 (Phe513Cys) does not alter the charge of the encoded amino acid, and affected family members have a near normal life expectancy. The Gly716Arg mutation (exon 19; charge change of +1) causes FHC in three family members, one of whom underwent transplantation for heart failure. The Arg719Trp mutation (exon 19; charge change of -1) was found in four unrelated FHC families with a high incidence of premature death and an average life expectancy in affected individuals of 38 yr. A comparable high frequency of disease-related deaths in four families with the Arg719Trp mutation suggests that this specific gene defect directly accounts for the observed malignant phenotype. Further, the significantly different life expectancies associated with the Arg719Trp vs. Phe513Cys mutation (P < 0.001) support the hypothesis that mutations which alter the charge of the encoded amino acid affect survival more significantly than those that produce a conservative amino acid change.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

The aim of the present study was to examine two rare missense polymorphisms of HNF4A, Thr130Ile and Val255Met, for altered function and for association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have examined these polymorphisms 1) by in vitro transactivation studies and 2) by genotyping the variants in 1409 T2D patients and in 4726 glucose-tolerant Danish white subjects. When tested in COS7 cells, both the Thr130Ile and the Val255Met variants showed a significant decrease in transactivation activity compared with wild-type (73% of wild-type, P = 0.02, and 76%, P = 0.04, respectively). The Thr130Ile variant had a significantly increased carrier frequency among T2D patients compared with glucose-tolerant subjects [odds ratio, 1.26 (1.01-1.57); P = 0.04]. The rare Val255Met polymorphism had a similar frequency among T2D patients and glucose-tolerant subjects. Heterozygous glucose-tolerant carriers of the variant showed, however, decreased levels of fasting serum C-peptide (76%; P = 0.03) and decreased fasting serum triglyceride (58%; P = 0.02). In conclusion, The Thr130Ile and the Val255Met polymorphisms decrease the transcriptional activity of HNF4A, and the Thr130Ile polymorphism associates with T2D, whereas the Val255Met variant associates with a decrease in fasting serum C-peptide.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In a small cohort of HCM patients (n=8), we searched for mutations in the two most common genes responsible for HCM and found four missense mutations in the MYH7 gene encoding cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (R204H, M493V, R719W, and R870H) and three mutations in the myosin-binding protein C3 gene (MYBPC3) including one missense (A848V) and two frameshift mutations (c.3713delTG and c.702ins26bp). The c.702ins26bp insertion resulted from the duplication of a 26-bp fragment in a 54-year-old female HCM patient presenting with clinical signs of heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction. Although such large duplications (>10 bp) in the MYBPC3 gene are very rare and have been identified only in 4 families reported so far, the identical duplication mutation was found earlier in a Dutch patient, demonstrating that it may constitute a hitherto unknown founder mutation in central European populations. This observation underscores the significance of insertions into the coding sequence of the MYBPC3 gene for the development and pathogenesis of HCM.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
24219368,"Noonan syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease; it is physically characterized by short stature, short neck, webbed neck, abnormal auricles, high arched palate, and cardiovascular malformation. Its pathological condition is thought to be due to a gain-of-function mutation in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. Eyelid abnormalities such as ocular hypertelorism and blepharoptosis are the most commonly observed eye complications.
We report a case of Noonan syndrome associated with mature cataract that required operation. A 42-year-old man was diagnosed with Noonan syndrome at the age of 1 year. He underwent an eye examination after complaining of decreased visual acuity in the right eye and was diagnosed with mature cataract, which was treated by cataract surgery. There were no intraoperative complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Protein analysis of lens capsule and epithelium at capsulorhexis showed MAPK cascade proteins such as ERK and p38MAPK were upregulated. An abnormality in the PTPN11 gene was also observed; a potential mechanism of cataract onset may be that opacity of the lens rapidly progressed due to abnormal activation of the Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway.
This case highlights the possible association of cataract formation with MAPK cascade protein upregulation in Noonan syndrome.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

To date, only 10 males with CDKL5 mutations have been reported. Our retrospective study reports on the clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular findings of 18 males with early-onset epilepsy caused by either CDKL5 or ARX mutations. These 18 patients include eight new males with CDKL5 mutations and 10 with ARX mutations identified through sequence analysis of 266 and 346 males, respectively, at our molecular diagnostic laboratory.

12944922,"E-cadherin germline missense mutations have been shown to be responsible for significant loss of protein activity. A new cytoplasmic E-cadherin germline missense mutation (V832 M) was recently identified in a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) Japanese family. This E-cadherin mutant was cloned in a Chinese hamster ovary cell model system and functionally characterized, in terms of aggregation and invasion. Cells expressing the germline V832M mutant fail to aggregate and invade into collagen, supporting the pathogenic role of this germline missense mutation in gastric cancer. We also tested the ability of this mutation to activate the TCF-LEF trascriptional activity, in comparison with three other E-cadherin missense mutations (T340A, A634V and A617T), associated to loss of E-cadherin function. All the E-cadherin mutants reduced TCF-LEF activation to a similar extent as the wild-type protein, suggesting that the oncogenic effect of the E-cadherin mutants is unlikely to be transmitted through a beta-catenin-dependent activation of the WNT pathway.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

There are no data available in Moroccan population.
In this work we describe the genetic analysis by mutation scanning using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and subsequent direct sequencing of 20 different PKU families from Morocco. We have also included the study of 7 Moroccan PKU patients living in Spain detected by the Spanish newborn screening program.
The mutational spectrum in the first sample included eight different changes, one of them, p.K85X, was novel. The most common mutation was the frame shift change p.G352fsdelG identified in 62.5% of the mutant chromosomes studied. Other changes (p.R176X, IVS10nt-11 g>a, p.W120X, p.A165T, p.R243X and p.R243Q) were identified, respectively, in 2 or 3 mutant alleles. All detected mutations were severe according to the classical phenotype of the patients. In the 7 patients living in Spain we have detected 4 severe mutations (p.G352fs, p.R176X, Y198fs and Exon3del) and also milder changes such as p.A403V, p.S196T, p.D145V and p.R408Q detected in 3 mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) patients and a novel p.L258P found in a mild PKU patient.

We examine the diagnostic accuracy of two genetic assays to predict BH4 responsiveness: to determine whether the AV sum test or mutation-status assessment test can obviate the need for BH4 loading in Chinese patients. The overall predicted response in 346 patients was 31.65% by the AV sum test and 25.43% by the other assay; both percentages were lower than 51.06% derived from loading results in 94 patients. Responders were compound heterozygotes with definite BH4 responsive mutations, while non-responders had null/null ones; some consistently with specific mutations and genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays were 81.1% and 92.5% for the AV sum, and 82.9%, 97.3% for the other. An AV sum cutoff >2 has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.9%, while the presence of at least one BH4 responsive mutation has a PPV of 97.1%. The two approaches showed good concordance. Our data confirmed that the mutation-status assessment has a higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting response for Chinese patients than the AV sum test.

No experimental structure of pendrin is currently available, making phenotype-genotype correlations difficult as predictions of transmembrane (TM) segments vary in number. Here, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) pendrin transmembrane domain model based on the SLC26Dg transporter.

Intrafamilial phenotypic variability was analyzed in multiplex EVA families carrying biallelic SLC26A4 mutations to identify the contribution of SLC26A4 mutations and other genetic or environmental factors influencing the clinical manifestations.
Retrospective case series.
Eleven multiplex Korean families with EVA and hearing loss that carry biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene were included. Genetic analysis for SLC26A4 and other genes including FOXI1, FOXI1-DBD, and KCNJ10 was performed. The auditory and other phenotypes were compared among siblings with the same SLC26A4 mutations.
The difference in the auditory phenotypes was identified between siblings in approximately half of the EVA families. Families with SLC26A4 mutations other than H723R homozygous mutations demonstrated more phenotypic variability, especially in those carrying IVS7-2A>G splice site mutation. Cochlear malformation was a consistent finding among siblings with the same SLC26A4 mutations. No mutation was identified in the FOXI1, FOXI1-DBD, and KCNJ10 genes in the tested families.
The possibility of variability concerning auditory phenotype should be considered even within family members carrying the same SLC26A4 mutations when providing genetic counseling to multiplex EVA families. Mutations in the currently known genes associated with EVA other than SLC26A4 were not found to be responsible for the intrafamilial phenotypic variability.

A comprehensive evaluation, based on different methodological approaches, confirmed the detrimental effect of the eight mutations on the protein and its function. Structural alterations potentially induced by the five missense mutations were also predicted through visual inspection of the atomic model of the GAA protein, in terms of both function and spatial orientation of specific residues as well as disturbance generated by amino acid substitutions.

Although some of them are recurrent, most have only been described once and appear to be restricted to one patient or to one family. The incidence of mt tRNA gene alterations is not known, even though the frequency of some recurrent mutations has been analysed both in patients and in the general population. In this study, we describe the results of stepwise screening for sequence variations in the mt tRNA genes of 166 patients selected according to several criteria. Extensive sequence analysis of the tRNA genes was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. A total of 31 patients (19%) were found to harbour significant levels of a pathogenic mutation, thus confirming the importance of mt tRNA mutations in human pathology. Forty-three different sequence variations were found, illustrating the great diversity of the mtDNA sequence in humans. The functional assessment of all these sequence variations represented a difficult task; it was mostly based on indirect data, such as the phylogenetic conservation of modified nucleotides and the proportions of variant species in different tissues of the index case or in blood of maternal relatives. Direct demonstration of a correlation between the proportion of heteroplasmic sequence variations and the cytochrome c oxidase defect was performed at the single muscle-fibre level. Eleven heteroplasmic sequence variations were found, six of which are new mutations. One is a known Caucasian polymorphism but the other 10 are pathogenic. Two of them are the well-known pathogenic MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) (A3243G) and MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres) (A8344G) point mutations. They were found in 23 patients. The eight other mutations were restricted to one patient. The pathogenic nature of these mutations was demonstrated directly for five of them and hypothesized from indirect arguments for the other three.

We report a case of Glanzmann thrombasthenia combined with type 2N von Willebrand disease (VWD), a variant characterized by an impaired capacity of FVIII to bind von Willebrand factor (VWF), which results in an autosomally transmitted reduction in circulating FVIII levels. Glanzmann thrombasthenia stems from compound T1214C and G1234A mutations in the ITGA2B gene; the type 2N VWD is due to a heterozygous G2561A mutation in the VWF gene (R854Q). The haemostatic phenotype of a 48-year-old female patient was unusually characterized by a severe chronic arthropathy with loss of cartilage and the presence of subchondrial cysts involving both ankles. The arthropathy was quantified with the compatible MRI scoring system (currently used to assess arthropathy in haemophilia), reaching almost the highest score. These haemorrhagic complications are very rare in Glanzmann thrombasthenia and resemble those seen in severe haemophilia; for such, a reason we decided to explore the patient's FVIII and VWF parameters.

DNA sequencing of PAH exon 2 revealed a G-to-A transition in cDNA position 136. G46S mutations were present on 17 of 236 Norwegian PKU alleles (7.2%) and on 8 of 176 Swedish PKU alleles (4.5%). Analysis of all 13 exons with the flanking regions further detected a 1316-35c > t polymorphism (PAH intron 12), associated with both G46S and haplotype 5.9. Three patients were homozygous for the G46S mutation, two were untreated and had mild and severe mental retardation, respectively. The G46S mutation was introduced in the PAH cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in three different systems (the pMAL/Escherichia coli system, the pcDNA3/human embryonic kidney (A293) cells, and the pcDNA3/TnT coupled in vitro transcription-translation system). The mutant recombinant E. coli fusion protein was recovered in high yield and with a specific activity of the purified tetrameric form, which was higher than the wild-type activity. After transient expression in A293 cells, the amount of the G46S protein was only about 3% of the wild type at equal PAH mRNA levels. The fusion protein cleaved by restriction protease factor Xa, as well as the enzyme produced by in vitro transcription-translation, revealed an abnormal susceptibility to form catalytically inactive high-molecular-mass aggregates of the enzyme.

17177198,"Mutations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 are implicated in human diseases, causing Noonan syndrome (NS) and related developmental disorders or contributing to leukemogenesis depending on the specific amino acid substitution involved. SHP-2 is composed by a catalytic (PTP) and two regulatory (N-SH2 and C-SH2) domains that bind to signaling partners and control the enzymatic activity by limiting the accessibility of the catalytic site. Wild type SHP-2 and four disease-associated mutants recurring in hematologic malignancies (Glu76Lys and Ala72Val) or causing NS (Glu76Asp and Ala72Ser), with affected residues located in the PTP-interacting region of the N-SH2 domain, were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro biochemical assays. Simulations demonstrate that mutations do not affect significantly the conformation of the N-SH2 domain. Rather they destabilize the interaction of this domain with the catalytic site, with more evident effects in the two leukemia associated mutants. Consistent with this structural evidence, mutants exhibit an increased level of basal phosphatase activity in the order Glu76Lys > Ala72Val > Glu76Asp > Ala72Ser > WT. The experimental data also show that the mutants with higher basal activity are more responsive to an activating phosphopeptide. A thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that an increase in the overall phosphopeptide affinity of mutants can be explained by a shift in the equilibrium between the inactive and active SHP-2 structure. These data support the view that an increase in the affinity of SHP-2 for its binding partners, caused by destabilization of the closed, inactive conformation, rather than protein basal activation per se, would represent the molecular mechanism, leading to pathogenesis in these mutants.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

A myeloproliferative disorder (NS/MPD), resembling juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), is occasionally diagnosed in infants with NS. In the present study, we performed a functional evaluation of the circulating hematopoietic progenitors in a series of NS, NS/MPD and JMML patients. The different functional patterns were compared with the aim to identify a possible NS subgroup worthy of stringent hematological follow-up for an increased risk of MPD development. We studied 27 NS and 5 JMML patients fulfilling EWOG-MDS criteria. The more frequent molecular defects observed in NS were mutations in the PTPN11 and SOS genes. The absolute count of monocytes, circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, their apoptotic rate and the number of circulating CFU-GMs cultured in the presence of decreasing concentrations or in the absence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were evaluated. All JMML patients showed monocytosis>1,000/µl. Ten out of the 27 NS patients showed monocytosis>1,000/µl, which included the 3 NS/MPD patients. In JMML patients, circulating CD34+ cells were significantly increased (median, 109.8/µl; range, 44-232) with a low rate of apoptosis (median, 2.1%; range, 0.4-12.1%), and circulating CFU-GMs were hyper-responsive to GM-CSF.

42 patients with the diagnoses of HCM made before age 18 years were treated in our center from 2000 to 2016. Genetic analysis was performed in 36 subjects, a genetic defect was detected in 29 (78%) patients. 15 individuals (42%) had pathogenic variants in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, and 5 (14%) in genes coding for components of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. 4 subjects (11%) had mutations in the GAA gene (Pompe disease), and 3 (8%) had Frataxin repeat expansions (Friedreich's ataxia). One patient each showed a mutation in BAG3 and LMNA. Discussion of unsolved HCM cases after performing next-generation sequencing (28 genes) in an interdisciplinary board unraveled the genetic cause in 9 subjects (25%).

Patients' medical records were collected and reviewed and respiratory and motor functions, before ERT initiation and upon last evaluation were compared.
Twelve patients (7 males) were identified. Median age at symptom onset was 24years [IQR=15.5; 36.0]. At baseline ventilation was invasive in 11 patients and noninvasive in one, with a median ventilation time of 24h [IQR=21.88; 24.00] (min 20; max 24). ERT was initiated at a median age of 52.5years [IQR=35.75; 66.50]. Median treatment duration was 55months [IQR=39.5; 81.0]. During observational period no adverse reaction to ERT was recorded, five patients (41.67%) died, three decreased their ventilation time by 30, 60 and 90min and two increased their assisted walking distance, by 80 and 20m.

Literatures that reported prevalence rates were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Cochrane library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Databases for the period from inception to August 2017. Random and fixed effects models were used to generate pooled ORs and I2values. The heterogeneity assumption decided the effect model.
A total of four relevant studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis indicated that the p.P240L variant was correlated with the risk of NHSL in Asian populations (OR = 10.17, 95% CI = 2.74-37.82, P = 0.001). The T allele of p.P240L was associated with a 12-fold higher risk of NSHL than the C allele (OR = 11.68; 95% CI = 3.16-43.24, P < 0.001). Specifically, p.P240L heterozygotes (OR = 8.49; 95% CI = 2.28-31.59, P = 0.001), had a significantly higher risk of NSHL. Publication bias of our meta-analysis was attributed to the limited availability of relevant results and the number of studies included in our meta-analysis was relatively small.
The p.P240L variant increased the risk of NHSL in Asian populations, suggesting a remarkable ethnic specificity linked with susceptibility to this mutation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
26884589,"Inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) contains several forms of familial thrombocytopenia and some of them have propensity to hematological malignancies. The etiological and genetic features of this heterogeneous syndrome have not yet been elucidated.
We conducted a nationwide survey to collect clinical information and samples from patients with familial thrombocytopenia and/or hematological malignancies in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of IT.
Among the 43 pedigrees with clinical samples, RUNX1 mutations were identified in 8 pedigrees (18.6%). While MYH9 and ANKRD26 mutations were identified in 2 and 1 pedigrees, respectively, no gene mutations were detected in the remaining 32 pedigrees from a panel of previously reported pathogenetic mutations. Clinical data were comparable between FPD/AML and non-FPD/AML probands.
Our study clarified that it is unexpectedly difficult to diagnose FPD/AML based on clinical information alone, and thus, genetic testing is strongly recommended. Our survey also identified some pedigrees with a strong family history of myelodysplastic syndromes of unknown origin. Additionally, there were 14 pedigrees in which three or more members were affected by immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and a computer-aided simulation suggested that such a distribution almost never happens by coincidence, which implicates a genetic predisposition to ITP.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
28755079,"A minor fraction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) develops in association with germline mutations of the genes responsible for inherited cancer syndromes. However, the PDAC that has a germline PTEN mutation has not received much attention. Genome-wide whole exome sequencing was performed on germline and somatic DNA from an 82-year-old woman who had developed a solid pancreatic cancer but did not show characteristic findings of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS). Histology of the resected pancreatic tumor showed unique PDAC findings of primarily dendriform structures and dense fibrous tissue, accompanied by multiple pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in the vicinity. The tumor immunohistochemistry revealed a loss of PTEN expression and overexpression of TP53. Exome sequencing revealed a K-ras mutation (p.Gly12Val). Germline exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation of PTEN (p.Arg234Gln), a rare variant with a reported association with cancer development but not with other PHTS phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PDAC associated with a germline PTEN mutation, particularly a rare variant (p.Arg234Gln) with cancer risks.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
16773562,"Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) are autosomal dominant hamartoma syndromes. Germline PTEN mutations have been associated with 85% of CS cases and 65% of BRRS cases and also with other disorders, which are collectively referred to as the ""PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome."" The human PTEN gene has been previously found to express two naturally occurring splice variants (SVs). Recently, we identified eight novel naturally occurring PTEN SVs that result in different downstream signaling effects: SV3a, SV3b, SV3c (inclusion of various lengths of intron 3 3' of exon 3), SV5a, SV5b, SV5c, SV5d (inclusion of various lengths of intron 5 3' of exon 5), and SV Delta Ex6 (deletion of exon 6). We therefore sought to characterize the relative expression of 5', middle, and 3' full-length PTEN mRNA (FL-PTEN) and also of these eight PTEN SVs in 85 (65 female and 20 male) patients with CS/BRRS (with or without PTEN mutations) compared with 27 controls, using a SYBR green quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Significantly reduced FL-PTEN levels were found in the probands, compared with those of controls (P < .01). Apart from FL-PTEN, SV3a is the most consistently relatively underexpressed in patients compared with controls. The patients showed relative underexpression of SV3a and SV3b and overexpression of SV5b (P = .005, P = .02, and P = .04, respectively). Indeed, there appears to be an SV expressional genotype-phenotype correlation in which the SV expressional profiles are distinct among CS, CS-like, and BRRS. The reduced FL-PTEN transcript expression, associated with differential expression of PTEN SVs, regardless of PTEN mutation status, supports the concept that modulation of PTEN inactivation may also occur at the transcription level influencing the specific phenotypes seen in these syndromes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

In this study, we targeted four candidate genes: JAK2 and RUNX1 genes assuring a prominent function in hematological process and CBL and NPM1 as proto-oncogenes. Their disruption was described in several sporadic hematological malignancies. The aim of this study is to determine whether JAK2, CBL, RUNX1, and NPM1 germline genes mutations are involved in familial hematological malignancies. Using direct sequencing, we analyzed JAK2 (exons 12 and 14); CBL (exons 7, 8 and 9); NPM1 (exon 12) and the entire RUNX1 in 88 independent families belonging to Tunisian and French populations. Twenty-one sporadic acute leukemias were included in this study. We reported a heterozygous intronic c.1641 + 6 T > C JAK2 variant (rs182123615) found in two independent familial cases diagnosed with gastric lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The in silico analysis suggested a potential impact on splicing, but the functional splicing minigene reporter assay on rs182123615 variant showed no aberrant transcripts. In one sporadic acute myeloblastic leukemia, we reported an insertion 846 in. TGTT in exon 12 of NPM1 gene that may impact the normal reading frame. The rs182123615 JAK2 variant was described in several contexts including myeloproliferative neoplasms and congenital erythrocytosis and was supposed to be pathogenic.

CHO cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding His327GPIIb showed a drastic reduction in the surface expression of alpha IIb beta 3 complex relative to control cells transfected with wild type GPIIb. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that GPIIb synthesis, heterodimerization, and short term maturation were not impeded, suggesting that conformational changes dependent on Arg327 of GPIIb may play an essential role in either the rate of maturation and/or transport of heterodimers to the cell surface. Cotransfection of CHO cells with equimolar amounts of cDNAs encoding wild type and mutant His327-GPIIb led to a marked reduction in the surface expression of alpha IIb beta 3. This novel observation of a dominant-negative effect of the mutant His 327 alpha IIb subunit provides a molecular basis for the reduced platelet alpha IIb beta 3 content observed in the heterozygous offspring.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
16570074,"Sensorineural hearing loss is the most frequent sensory deficit of childhood and is of genetic origin in up to 75% of cases. It has been shown that mutations of the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene were involved in syndromic deafness characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing impairment and goitre (Pendred's syndrome), as well as in congenital isolated deafness (DFNB4). While the prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations in Pendred's syndrome is clearly established, it remains to be studied in large cohorts of patients with nonsyndromic deafness and detailed clinical informations. In this report, 109 patients from 100 unrelated families, aged from 1 to 32 years (median age: 10 years), with nonsyndromic deafness and enlarged vestibular aqueduct, were genotyped for SLC26A4 using DHPLC molecular screening and sequencing. In all, 91 allelic variants were observed in 100 unrelated families, of which 19 have never been reported. The prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations was 40% (40/100), with biallelic mutation in 24% (24/100), while six families were homozygous. All patients included in this series had documented deafness, associated with EVA and without any evidence of syndromic disease. Among patients with SLC26A4 biallelic mutations, deafness was more severe, fluctuated more than in patients with no mutation. In conclusion, the incidence of SLC26A4 mutations is high in patients with isolated deafness and enlarged vestibular aqueduct and could represent up to 4% of nonsyndromic hearing impairment. SLC26A4 could be the second most frequent gene implicated in nonsyndromic deafness after GJB2, in this Caucasian population.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Decade audiograms were also compared among two groups of affected subjects with different mutations of USH2A.
DNA samples from patients with Usher syndrome type II were analysed. The audiological features of patients and affected siblings with USH2A mutations were also examined to identify genotype-phenotype correlations.
Genetic and audiometric examinations were performed in 18 subjects from nine families with Usher syndrome type IIA.
Three different USH2A mutations were identified in the affected subjects. Both similarities and differences of the auditory phenotype were seen in families with several affected siblings. A variable degree of hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound, was observed among affected subjects. No significant differences in hearing thresholds were found the group of affected subjects with different pathological mutations.

Overall, we identified pathogenic mutations in 10% of our cohort. Six of the 46 candidate genes had 1 or more pathogenic variants, collectively accounting for 3% of our cohort. We show that de novo CHD2 and SYNGAP1 mutations are new causes of epileptic encephalopathies, accounting for 1.2% and 1% of cases, respectively. We also expand the phenotypic spectra explained by SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN8A mutations.

32237906,"Integrin β3 is implicated in numerous biological processes such as its relevance to blood triglyceride, yet whether β3 deficiency affects this metabolic process remains unknown. Approach and Results: We showed that the Chinese patients with β3-deficient Glanzmann thrombasthenia had a 2-fold higher serum triglyceride level together with a lower serum LPL (lipoprotein lipase) level than those with an αIIb deficiency or healthy subjects. The β3 knockout mice recapitulated these phenotypic features. The elevated plasma triglyceride level was due to impaired LPL-mediated triglyceride clearance caused by a disrupted LPL secretion. Further analysis revealed that β3 directly bound LPL via a juxtamembrane TIH (threonine isoleucine histidine)720-722motif in its cytoplasmic domain and functioned as an adaptor protein by interacting with LPL and PKD (protein kinase D) to form the PKD/β3/LPL complex that is required for β3-mediated LPL secretion. Furthermore, the impaired triglyceride clearance in β3 knockout mice could be corrected by adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated delivery of wild-type but not TIH720-722-mutated β3 genes.
This study reveals a hypertriglyceridemia in both β3-deficient Chinese patients and mice and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the significant roles of β3 in LPL secretion and triglyceride metabolism, drawing attention to the metabolic consequences in patients with β3-deficient Glanzmann thrombasthenia.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The all 13 exons and adjacent intronic regions of the PAH gene were determined by next-generation sequencing. We identified 194 different mutations, of which 41 are not reported before. Several mutations reoccurred with high frequency including p.R243Q, p.EX6-96A > G, p.V399V, p.R241C, p.R111*, p.Y356*, p.R413P, and IVS4-1G > A. 76.33% of mutations were localized in exons 3, 6, 7, 11, 12.

26666653,"Mutations in Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH) gene cause phenylketonuria. Sapropterin (BH4), the enzyme cofactor, is an important therapeutical strategy in phenylketonuria. However, PAH is a highly polymorphic gene and it is difficult to identify BH4-responsive genotypes. We seek here to improve prediction of BH4-responsiveness through comparison of genotypes, BH4-loading test, predictions of responsiveness according to the literature and types and locations of mutations.
A total of 364 French patients among which, 9 % had mild hyperphenylalaninemia, 17.7 % mild phenylketonuria and 73.1 % classical phenylketonuria, benefited from a 24-hour BH4-loading test and had the PAH gene sequenced and analyzed by Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification.
Overall, 31.6 % of patients were BH4-responsive. The number of different mutations found was 127, including 26 new mutations. The mutations c.434A > T, c.500A > T, c.529G > C, c.1045 T > G and c.1196 T > C were newly classified as being BH4-responsive. We identified 261 genotypes, among which 46 were newly recognized as being BH4-responsive. Even though patients carry 2 responsive alleles, BH4-responsiveness cannot be predicted with certainty unless they present mild hyperphenylalaninemia. BH4-responsiveness cannot be predicted in patients carrying one responsive mutation only. In general, the milder the phenotype is, the stronger the BH4-response is. Almost exclusively missense mutations, particularly in exons 12, 11 and 8, are associated with BH4-responsiveness and any other type of mutation predicts a negative response.
This study is the first of its kind, in a French population, to identify the phenotype associated with several combinations of PAH mutations. As others, it highlights the necessity of performing simultaneously BH4 loading test and molecular analysis in monitoring phenylketonuria patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

We describe the search for CDH1 mutations in 36 new diffuse gastric cancer families. All 16 CDH1 exons, neighbouring intronic sequence and an essential promoter region were screened by DNA sequencing. We detected nine different mutations, seven of which were novel. Of the seven novel mutations, five were identified in families who met the IGCLC clinical criteria for HDGC. Two mutations resulted in a premature stop codon and truncation of the protein. Three mutations affected splice sites; two of the splice-site mutations were shown by RT-PCR to disturb normal CDH1 splicing, while the third splice-site mutation was present in two unrelated HDGC families. The remaining two mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions and impaired the ability of E-cadherin protein to form cellular aggregates and suppress invasion in vitro. Together with the occurrence of extra-gastric tumours such as lobular breast and colorectal cancer, these findings further extend the types of CDH1 mutations and the spectrum of tumours associated with HDGC.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

24047955,"It is unclear why mutations in the filament-forming tail of myosin heavy chain (MHC) cause hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy as these mutations should not directly affect contraction. To investigate this, we first investigated the impact of five hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing (N1327K, E1356K, R1382W, E1555K, and R1768K) and one dilated cardiomyopathy-causing (R1500W) tail mutations on their ability to incorporate into muscle sarcomeres in vivo. We used adenoviral delivery to express full-length wild type or mutant enhanced GFP-MHC in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Three mutations (N1327K, E1356K, and E1555K) reduced enhanced GFP-MHC incorporation into muscle sarcomeres, whereas the remainder had no effect. No mutations significantly affected contraction. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that fluorescence recovery for the mutation that incorporated least well (N1327K) was significantly faster than that of WT with half-times of 25.1 ± 1.8 and 32.2 ± 2.5 min (mean ± S.E.), respectively. Next, we determined the effects of each mutation on the helical properties of wild type and seven mutant peptides (7, 11, or 15 heptads long) from the myosin tail by circular dichroism. R1382W and E1768K slightly increased the α-helical nature of peptides. The remaining mutations reduced α-helical content, with N1327K showing the greatest reduction. Only peptides containing residues 1301-1329 were highly α-helical suggesting that this region helps in initiation of coiled coil.

To clarify the relation between profound non-syndromic deafness and GJB2 mutation in Japanese children, we performed genetic testing for GJB2.
We conducted mutation screening employing PCR and direct sequencing for GJB2 in 126 children who had undergone cochlear implantation with congenital deafness.
We detected 10 mutations, including two unreported mutations (p.R32S and p.P225L) in GJB2. We identified the highest-frequency mutation (c.235delC: 44.8%) and other nonsense or truncating mutations, as in previous studies. However, in our research, p.R143W, which is one of the missense mutations, may also show an important correlation with severe deafness.

A large number of mutations in the acid α-glucosidase gene have been described to date. Among them, ~15% are variations that may affect mRNA splicing process. In this study, we have for the first time comprehensively reviewed the available information on splicing mutations of the acid α-glucosidase gene and we have evaluated their possible impact on the splicing process using different in silico approaches. Out of the 39 different GAA-sequence variations described, an in silico analysis using seven different programs showed that 97% of them are predicted to have an impact on the splicing process. Moreover, this analysis showed a quite good correlation between the impact of the mutation on the splicing process and the clinical phenotype. In addition, we have performed the functional characterization of three novel sequence variants found in Italian patients and still uncharacterized. Using a minigene system, we have confirmed their pathogenic nature. In conclusion, this study has shown that in silico analysis represents a useful tool to select mutations that affect the splicing process of the acid α-glucosidase gene and provides an updated picture of all this kind of mutations reported till now.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

A spectrum of HPA candidate genes in 1020 Chinese HPA patients was reported. Sanger sequencing, next generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were applied to precisely molecular diagnose HPA patients. The allelic phenotype values (APV) and genotypic phenotype values (GPV) were calculated in PAH-deficient patients based on a recently developed formula.

The sarcoglycans (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan) form a tetrameric complex at the muscle membrane that is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and plays an essential role for membrane integrity during muscle contractions. We previously showed that the most frequent missense mutation in α-sarcoglycan (p.R77C) leads to the absence of the protein at the cell membrane due to its blockade by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibition of the ER α-mannosidase I activity using kifunensine could rescue the mutant protein localization at the cell membrane. Here, we investigate 25 additional disease-causing missense mutations in the sarcoglycan genes with respect to intracellular fate and localization rescue of the mutated proteins by kifunensine. Our studies demonstrate that, similarly to p.R77C, 22 of 25 of the selected mutations lead to defective intracellular trafficking of the SGs proteins.

12897283,"Infantile Pompe's disease is a lethal cardiac and muscular disorder. Current developments toward enzyme replacement therapy are promising. The aim of our study is to delineate the natural course of the disease to verify endpoints of clinical studies.
A total of 20 infantile patients diagnosed by the collaborative Dutch centers and 133 cases reported in literature were included in the study. Information on clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic parameters was collected.
The course of Pompe's disease is essentially the same in the Dutch and the general patient population. Symptoms start at a median age of 1.6 months in both groups. The median age of death is 7.7 and 6 months, respectively. Five percent of the Dutch patients and 8% of all reported patients survive beyond 1 year of age. Only 2 patients from literature became older than 18 months. A progressive cardiac hypertrophy is characteristic for infantile Pompe's disease. The diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall and cardiac weight at autopsy increase significantly with age. Motor development is severely delayed and major developmental milestones are generally not achieved. For the Dutch patient group, growth deviates significantly from normal despite start of nasogastric tube feeding. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, or creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme are typically elevated, although aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase increase significantly with age. The patients have fully deleterious mutations. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity is severely deficient.
Survival, decrease of the diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and achievement of major motor milestones are valid endpoints for therapeutic studies of infantile Pompe's disease. Mutation analysis and measurement of the alpha-glucosidase activity should be part of the enrollment program.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
17615537,"To retrospectively investigate the contribution of myocilin (MYOC) and optineurin (OPTN) sequence variations to adult-onset ocular hypertension (OHT) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in Spanish patients.
The promoter region and the three exons of MYOC were analyzed by direct PCR DNA sequencing in 40 OHT and 110 POAG unrelated patients. We used 98 subjects in whom OHT or glaucoma had been ruled out as controls. We also screened the complete coding region of the OPTN gene (exons 4-16) in all subjects by single-stranded conformational polymorphisms (SSCPs).
We identified six common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of MYOC (-1000C>G, -387C>T, -306G>A, -224T>C, -126T>C and -83G>A) and a polymorphic GT microsatellite (-339(GT)11-19). In addition, we detected four novel, rare DNA polymorphisms. None of these DNA sequence variations were associated with either OHT or POAG. We also found three (2.7%) POAG patients with MYOC pathogenic mutations. Two of these pathogenic mutations (Gln368Stop and Ala445Val) were previously described whereas the third (Tyr479His) was novel. Transient expression of the novel mutation in 293T cells supported its pathogenicity. Only two OPTN polymorphisms, which are not associated with the disease, were detected.
Overall, our data show that in Spain a minority of adult-onset high-pressure POAG patients carry heterozygous disease-causing mutations in the MYOC gene and that OPTN is not involved in either OHT or POAG.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term results in those who screened positive for deafness mutations; these results are crucial to determine the cost-effectiveness to justify population-wide genetic screening.
We performed simultaneous hearing screening and genetic screening targeting four common deafness mutations (p.V37I and c.235delC of GJB2, c.919-2A>G of SLC26A4, and the mitochondrial m.1555A>G) in 5173 newborns at a tertiary hospital between 2009 and 2015. Serial audiometric results up to 6 years old were then analyzed in children with conclusive genotypes.
Newborn genetic screening identified 82 (1.6%) babies with conclusive genotypes, comprising 62 (1.2%) with GJB2 p.V37I/p.V37I, 16 (0.3%) with GJB2 p.V37I/c.235delC, and 4 (0.1%) with m.1555A>G. Of these, 46 (56.1%) passed hearing screening at birth. Long-term follow-up demonstrated progressive hearing loss in children with the GJB2 p.V37I/p.V37I and p.V37I/c.235delC genotypes; this hearing loss deteriorated by approximately 1 decibel hearing level (dBHL) per year.
We delineated the longitudinal auditory features of the highly prevalent GJB2 p.V37I mutation on a general population basis and confirmed the utility of newborn genetic screening in identifying infants with late-onset or progressive hearing impairment undetectable by newborn hearing screening.Genet Med 19 1, 6-12.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

The transfected cDNA, its expression and the ability of cells binding to PAC-1 and fibrinogen were investigated by RT-PCR, DNA sequence analysis, flow cytometry and Western blotting.
The integrin alpha II b beta 3 level in the patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia was significantly lower than that of the normal subjects and the platelets of the patients failed to bind PAC-1 activated by ADP. There were both C3077G and G3078C mutations in exon 30 of mutant alpha II bR995A beta 3 cDNA, which resulted in an amino acid substitution arginine (R) 995 to alanine (A). CHO cells transfected with wild-type alpha II b beta 3 or mutant alpha II bR995A beta 3 cDNA respectively expressed normal alpha II b beta 3 and mutant alpha II bR995A beta 3. When cells were not activated, wild-type alpha II b beta 3 CHO cells failed to bind PAC-1, but could adhere to fibrinogen, but mutant chimera alpha II bR995A beta 3 CHO cells were able to bind PAC-1 and exhibited high affinity binding fibrinogen.
The point mutation in integrin alpha II bR995A can induce the inside-out signal transduction in platelets, and have integrin alpha II bR995A beta 3 locked into an activation state; the defect of alpha II b beta 3 in patients with GT impairs the inside-out signal transduction mediated by alpha II b beta 3 in platelets and the adhesive functions of platelets.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The increasing availability of treatments and the importance of early intervention have stimulated newborn screening (NBS) to diagnose LSDs and permit early intervention to prevent irreversible impairment or severe disability. We present our experience screening newborns in North East Italy to identify neonates with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) and Pompe, Fabry, and Gaucher diseases.
Activities of acid β-glucocerebrosidase (ABG; Gaucher), acid α-glucosidase (GAA; Pompe), acid α-galactosidase (GLA; Fabry), and acid α-L-iduronidase (IDUA; MPS-I) in dried blood spots (DBS) from all newborns during a 17-month period were determined by multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the NeoLSD®assay system. Enzymatic activity cutoff values were determined from 3500 anonymous newborn DBS. In the screening study, samples were retested if the value was below cutoff and a second spot was requested, with referral for confirmatory testing and medical evaluation if a low value was obtained.
From September 2015 to January 2017, 44,411 newborns were screened for the four LSDs. We recalled 40 neonates (0.09%) for collection of a second DBS. Low activity was confirmed in 20, who had confirmatory testing. Ten of 20 had pathogenic mutations: two Pompe, two Gaucher, five Fabry, and one MPS-I. The incidences of Pompe and Gaucher diseases were similar (1/22,205), with Fabry disease the most frequent (1/8882) and MPS-I the rarest (1/44411). The combined incidence of the four disorders was 1/4411 births.
Simultaneously determining multiple enzyme activities by MS/MS, with a focus on specific biochemical markers, successfully detected newborns with LSDs. The high incidence of these disorders supports this screening program.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
25657822,"Individuals with the CDKL5 disorder have been described as having severely impaired development. A few individuals have been reported having attained more milestones including walking and running. Our aim was to investigate variation in attainment of developmental milestones and associations with underlying genotype.
Data was sourced from the International CDKL5 Disorder Database, and individuals were included if they had a pathogenic or probably pathogenic CDKL5 mutation and information on early development. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analyses investigated the occurrence of developmental milestones. Mutations were grouped by their structural/functional consequence, and Cox regression was used to investigate the relationship between genotype and milestone attainment.
The study included 109 females and 18 males. By 5 years of age, only 75% of the females had attained independent sitting and 25% independent walking whilst a quarter of the males could sit independently by 1 year 3 months. Only one boy could walk independently. No clear relationship between mutation group and milestone attainment was present, although females with a late truncating mutation attained the most milestones.
Attainment of developmental milestones is severely impaired in the CDKL5 disorder, with the majority who did attain skills attaining them at a late age. It appears as though males are more severely impaired than the females. Larger studies are needed to further investigate the role of genotype on clinical variability.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
12189493,"Mutations in the connexin26 (GJB2) gene account for about half of inherited non-syndromic deafness cases in Western countries. The connexin26 protein is a subunit of gap junctions that form a network of intercellular communication among supporting cells and fibrocytes in the mammalian inner ear. Here we describe functional implications of mutations in the coding region of connexin26 genes (M1V, M34T, L90P, R127H, F161S, P173R, and R184P), identified in patients and stably transfected in human HeLa cells. While all mutated connexin26 cDNAs were transcribed, only M34T, L90P, R127H, F161S, and R184P were translated in HeLa cells. Analysis of indirect immunofluorescence showed membranous localization, strong for M34T, L90P, R127H, and very weak for F161S, but no signal corresponding to M1V, P173R and R184P. Tracer coupling experiments revealed diffusion of microinjected neurobiotin into neighbouring cells in the case of M34T and R127H, whereas M1V, L90P, F161S, P173R and R184P mutants did not show intercellular coupling. The results of oligomerisation studies suggested a partly disturbed assembly of hemichannels in M34T and L90P mutants but complete absence of hemichannel formation in the R184P mutant. The R127H mutation did not affect channel formation and is likely to represent a polymorphism. Our results show that mutations in the connexin26 gene can affect gap junctional intercellular communication at the level of protein translation, trafficking or assembly of hemichannels.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
23151025,"Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes the anion transporter, pendrin, are a major cause of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in some Asian populations. SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G (IVS7-2A>G) is the most common mutation in East Asian deaf populations. To provide a basis for improving the clinical diagnosis of deaf patients, we evaluated 80 patients with the SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G monoallelic mutation from 1065 hearing-impaired subjects and reported the occurrence of a second mutant allele in these patients.
The occurrence of a second mutant allele in these 80 patients with a single c.919-2A>G mutation was investigated. Mutation screening was performed by bidirectional sequencing in SLC26A4 exons 2 to 6 and 9 to 21.
We found that 47/80 patients carried another SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G compound mutation. The five most common mutations were: p.H723R, p.T410M, 15+5G>A (c.1705+5G>A), p.L676Q and p.N392Y. We found a Chinese-specific SLC26A4 mutation spectrum and an associated SLC26A4 contribution to deafness.
Our study illustrates that mutation analysis of other SLC26A4 exons should be undertaken in deaf patients with a single heterozygous SLC26A4 mutation. Moreover, a model of compound heterozygosity may partially explain the disease phenotype.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh's disease and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects, but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4, ND5, and ND6. We report the first four cases of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene. Three unrelated children have the same novel heteroplasmic mutation (T10158C), only the second mutation reported in ND3, and one has the previously identified T10191C mutation. Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I, suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport, proton pumping, or ubiquinone binding. Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation, with no mutation detected in maternal relatives. Mitochondrial DNA disease may be considerably more prevalent in the pediatric population than currently predicted and should be considered in patients with infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies and complex I deficiency.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

508 Patients with presumed ARNSHL were analyzed by applying ARMS-PCR, SSCP, PCR-RFLP and sequencing assays.
Seventy-five (14.7%) different homozygous and eighty-seven (17.1%) different compound heterozygous genotypes were detected in this cohort. Concerning the GJB2 gene, c.35delG was the most prevalent mutation, accounting for 16.4% of the samples. In addition 29 sequence variations other than c.35delG mutation were distinguished in GJB2; namely, delE120, Ins A 290-291, R143Q, V37I, R32H, Y155X, V27I + T123N, F154F, 167delT, 312del14, 299-300delA, T8M, W24X, E114G + V27I, 235delC, R184P, V153I, S139N, A171T, M163V (unknown mutation), G127V, E147X, R127H, 35insG, R143W, V27I, G160S, E114G and IVS1 + 1G > A. Moreover, the IVS1 + 1G > A was accounted as a second common mutation.

Among 132,538 newborns screened, 107 babies (1 in 1239) who had low dried blood spot GAA activity were genotyped. Sixty-nine (64.5%) babies had a total of 54 mutations and 35 novel predictably pathogenic mutations; 36 babies (33.6%) who had no mutation were homozygous for the c.[1726A; 2065A] pseudodeficiency allele. Because 81% of the chromosomes (14% in the controls) were in haplotype *03, we found a link between the pseudodeficiency allele and other mutated alleles. The newborns with Pompe disease detected by screening had lymphocyte GAA activities 0.45 to 1.65 nmol/mg/h (normal 66.7+/-33.8), while only 2 of the 100 false-positive cases had GAA activity less than 2.00 nmol/mg/h (or 3% of the normal mean).

10072428,"Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer. Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations, by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. Each family contained: (i) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer. Thus, CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

The purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum of mutations responsible for PAH deficiency in the United States. One hundred forty-nine patients enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study were subjects for clinical and molecular investigations. PAH gene mutations associated with phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) were identified on 279 of 294 independent mutant chromosomes, a diagnostic efficiency of 95%. The spectrum is composed of 71 different mutations, including 47 missense mutations, 11 splice mutations, 5 nonsense mutations, and 8 microdeletions. Sixteen previously unreported mutations were identified. Among the novel mutations, five were found in patients with MHP, and the remainder were found in patients with PKU. The most common mutations were R408W, IVS12nt1g-->a, and Y414C, accounting for 18.7%, 7.8%, and 5.4% of the mutant chromosomes, respectively. Thirteen mutations had relative frequencies of 1%-5%, and 55 mutations each had frequencies < or = 1%. The mutational spectrum corresponded to that observed for the European ancestry of the U.S. population. To evaluate the extent of allelic variation at the PAH locus within the United States in comparison with other populations, we used allele frequencies to calculate the homozygosity for 11 populations where >90% ascertainment of mutations has been obtained. The United States was shown to contain one of the most heterogeneous populations, with homozygosity values similar to Sicily and ethnically mixed sample populations in Europe. The extent of allelic heterogeneity must be a major determining factor in the choice of mutation-detection methodology for molecular diagnosis in PAH deficiency.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

We wanted to investigate the role of sarcomere protein gene variants in Finnish DCM patients.
We screened all coding exons of five sarcomere protein genes (beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-tropomyosin, troponin C, troponin I and troponin T) in a well-characterized population of 52 DCM patients in Eastern Finland by the PCR-SSCP and sequencing method. Two novel mutations, Arg1053Gln and Arg1500Trp, in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene in two index patients were detected. The proband with the Arg1053Gln mutation had a dilated left ventricle and impaired systolic function, but other family members carrying this mutation presented with septal hypertrophy. It thus seems that the Arg1053Gln mutation is primarily a HCM mutation, which can also lead to DCM. The other mutation, Arg1500Trp, was associated with a typical DCM phenotype. The Arg1500Trp mutation carrier had only one family member alive, but she did not carry the mutation and, therefore, cosegregation of the mutation and the disease in this family could not be reliably verified. No disease-causing mutations were found in the other sarcomere protein genes.
Two novel mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene were detected in patients with DCM. Overall, mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene seem to be relatively uncommon in Finnish DCM patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

27413125,"To prevent cognitive impairment, phenylketonuria requires lifelong management of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration with a low-Phe diet. The diet restricts intake of Phe from natural proteins in combination with traditional amino acid medical foods (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MFs) that contain primarily intact protein and a small amount of Phe.
We investigated the efficacy and safety of a low-Phe diet combined with GMP-MFs or AA-MFs providing the same quantity of protein equivalents in free-living subjects with phenylketonuria.
This 2-stage, randomized crossover trial included 30 early-treated phenylketonuria subjects (aged 15-49 y), 20 with classical and 10 with variant phenylketonuria. Subjects consumed, in random order for 3 wk each, their usual low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. The treatments were separated by a 3-wk washout with AA-MFs. Fasting plasma amino acid profiles, blood Phe concentrations, food records, and neuropsychological tests were obtained.
The frequency of medical food intake was higher with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs. Subjects rated GMP-MFs as more acceptable than AA-MFs and noted improved gastrointestinal symptoms and less hunger with GMP-MFs. ANCOVA indicated no significant mean ± SE increase in plasma Phe (62 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.136), despite a significant increase in Phe intake from GMP-MFs (88 ± 6 mg Phe/d, P = 0.026). AA-MFs decreased plasma Phe (-85 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.044) with stable Phe intake. Blood concentrations of Phe across time were not significantly different (AA-MFs = 444 ± 34 μmol/L, GMP-MFs = 497 ± 34 μmol/L), suggesting similar Phe control. Results of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function were not significantly different.
GMP-MFs provide a safe and acceptable option for the nutritional management of phenylketonuria. The greater acceptability and fewer side effects noted with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs may enhance dietary adherence for individuals with phenylketonuria.

In this study, we investigated the underlying genetic causes in patients with EOEE associated with infantile movement disorders.
We examined 11 patients with EOEE and involuntary movements (nine with West syndrome and two with nonsyndromic epileptic encephalopathy). All showed severe developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and involuntary movements such as chorea, ballism, dyskinesia or myoclonus, and hand stereotypies. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 10 patients, while the other patient underwent high-resolution melting analysis of candidate EOEE genes.
We identified mutations in CDKL5, SCN2A, SETD5, ALG13, and TBL1XR1 in seven patients with West syndrome, and in SCN1A and GRIN1 in the two patients with unclassified epileptic encephalopathy. All mutations were validated as de novo events. The genetic cause was undetermined in the remaining two patients.
We found pathogenic mutations in seven genes, in nine of 11 patients with EOEE and involuntary movements. Although the results of our study are preliminary because of the small number of patients, they nevertheless suggest that specific accompanying phenotypes such as hyperkinetic movements or hand stereotypies could be important in narrowing the disease spectrum and identifying causative genetic abnormalities.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs.

RFLP analysis of single muscle fibers demonstrated segregation of higher percentages of mutated genomes in COX-negative ragged red fibres compared with normal fibers. A predominant impairment in synthesis of subunits I and III of complex IV due to their highest relative content of tryptophane might explain the greater susceptibility of complex IV to the pathogenic effect of this mutation.

Wild-type and mutant channels demonstrated comparable ionic coupling, and their average unitary conductance was approximately 106 and approximately 60 pS in 120 mM K(+)-aspartate(-) and TEA(+)-aspartate(-) solution, respectively, documenting their equivalent permeability to K(+) and TEA(+). Comparison of cAMP, Lucifer Yellow (LY), and ethidium bromide (EtBr) transfer revealed differences in selectivity for larger anionic and cationic tracers. cAMP and LY permeability to wild-type and mutant channels was similar, whereas the transfer of EtBr through mutant channels was greatly reduced compared with wild-type junctions. Altered permeability of Cx26 to large cationic molecules suggests an essential role for biochemical coupling in cochlear homeostasis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In 40% of the families, a mutation in the CDH1 gene (E-cadherin) can be identified. Furthermore, the identification of the pathogenic mutation enables the segregate non-carriers (having population risk) and carriers. Prevention for the latter group includes prophylactic gastrectomy or surveillance endoscopy every 6 to 12 months.

28 year-old woman who underwent gastrectomy for a diffuse type gastric cancer. Her family background showed multiple gastric cancers with inherited autosomal-dominant pattern (affectation of 9 members in 5 generations). Suspecting HDGC, a plan of surveillance endoscopy was iniciated, and a her DNA sample was sequenced for CDH1 gene finding a non-sense mutation in position 1913 G>A (W638X) of exon 12.

Eighteen consecutive patients with CDH1 mutations and positive family history were studied prospectively, including 13 without and 5 with symptoms. Proportions were compared by Fisher's exact test, and survival by the Breslow modification of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Each patient underwent total gastrectomy (TG), and 17 (94%) were found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. Twelve of 13 asymptomatic patients had T1, N0 cancer, and only 2/12 (16%) had it diagnosed preoperatively despite state-of-the-art screening methods. Each asymptomatic patient did well postoperatively, and no patient has recurred. For five symptomatic patients, each (100%) was found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (P = 0.002 versus asymptomatic) by preoperative endoscopy; three (60%) had lymph node involvement and two (40%) had distant metastases at time of operation. Two-year survival was 100% for asymptomatic and 40% for symptomatic patients (P < 0.01).
The data show that asymptomatic patients with family history of HDGC and CDH1 mutation have high probability of having signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach that is not able to be diagnosed on endoscopy; when symptoms arise, the diagnosis can be made by endoscopy, but they have metastases and decreased survival.

25404053,"Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease that associates sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa and, in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. To date, 10 genes have been associated with the disease, making its molecular diagnosis based on Sanger sequencing, expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to develop a molecular diagnostics method for Usher syndrome, based on targeted next generation sequencing.
A custom HaloPlex panel for Illumina platforms was designed to capture all exons of the 10 known causative Usher syndrome genes (MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, USH1G, CIB2, USH2A, GPR98, DFNB31 and CLRN1), the two Usher syndrome-related genes (HARS and PDZD7) and the two candidate genes VEZT and MYO15A. A cohort of 44 patients suffering from Usher syndrome was selected for this study. This cohort was divided into two groups: a test group of 11 patients with known mutations and another group of 33 patients with unknown mutations.
Forty USH patients were successfully sequenced, 8 USH patients from the test group and 32 patients from the group composed of USH patients without genetic diagnosis. We were able to detect biallelic mutations in one USH gene in 22 out of 32 USH patients (68.75%) and to identify 79.7% of the expected mutated alleles. Fifty-three different mutations were detected. These mutations included 21 missense, 8 nonsense, 9 frameshifts, 9 intronic mutations and 6 large rearrangements.
Targeted next generation sequencing allowed us to detect both point mutations and large rearrangements in a single experiment, minimizing the economic cost of the study, increasing the detection ratio of the genetic cause of the disease and improving the genetic diagnosis of Usher syndrome patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
19862843,"Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Recently, small molecule pharmacological chaperones have been shown to increase protein stability and cellular levels for mutant lysosomal enzymes and have emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LSDs. In this study, we characterized the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) on 76 different mutant forms of GAA identified in Pompe disease. DNJ significantly increased enzyme activity and protein levels for 16 different GAA mutants in patient-derived fibroblasts and in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Additionally, DNJ increased the processing of these GAA mutants to their mature lysosomal forms, suggesting facilitated trafficking through the secretory pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed increased colocalization of GAA with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 after incubation with DNJ, confirming increased lysosomal trafficking. Lastly, a GAA structural model was constructed based on the related eukaryotic glucosidase maltase-glucoamylase. The mutated residues identified in responsive forms of GAA are located throughout most of the structural domains, with half of these residues located in two short regions within the catalytic domain. Taken together, these data support further evaluation of DNJ as a potential treatment for Pompe disease in patients that express responsive forms of GAA.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The F299C mutation occurred exclusively on mutant haplotype 8, and was the only mutation associated with this haplotype (on six chromosomes). One patient homozygous for each mutation was found. The patient homozygous for F299C manifested severe PKU, whereas the R408Q homozygote exhibited a mild PKU variant. Pedigree analysis of these families has not, so far, revealed consanguinity.

The method of dried blood spots (DBS) was applied to collect peripheral blood samples, and the activity of acid alpha-D-glucosidase (GAA) in leukocytes was measured. The coding region of GAA gene in this pedigree was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then direct sequencing was used to analyze mutations in GAA gene. The two infants were twins, who were admitted to the hospital due to feeding difficulties, generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia, cardiomegaly, and cardiac insufficiency when they were 10 months old. The GAA activity in leukocytes in the two infants was significantly lower than in normal controls. Gene sequencing revealed 2 compound heterozygous mutations in the two infants, i.e., G1942A and G2214A, respectively. G1942A had been proved pathogenic, and the latter one, G2214A, was a nonsense mutation, resulting in the change of tryptophan, the 738th amino acid of GAA, into a stop codon. The two infants were diagnosed with GSD II by gene detection and no enzyme replacement therapy could be provided to them. Follow-up visits showed that the two infants died at home at the age of 15 months and 17 months, respectively. GSD II is caused by deficiency of GAA activity resulting from mutation of GAA gene.

14681498,"A novel therapeutic strategy for phenylketonuria (PKU) has been initiated in Japan. A total of 12 patients who met the criteria for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4))-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) with a mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) (EC 1.14.16.1) gene were recruited at 12 medical centers in Japan between June 1995 and July 2001. Therapeutic efficacy of BH(4) was evaluated in single-dose, four-dose, and 1-wk BH(4) loading tests followed by long-term BH(4) treatment, and also examined in relation to the PAH gene mutations. The endpoints were determined as the percentage decline in serum phenylalanine from initial values after single-dose (>20%), four-dose (>30%), and 1-wk BH(4) (>50%) loading tests. Patients with mild PKU exhibiting decreases in blood phenylalanine concentrations of >20% in the single-dose test also demonstrated decreases of >30% in the four-dose test. The 1-wk test elicited BH(4) responsiveness even in patients with poor responses in the shorter tests. Patients with mild HPA, many of whom carry the R241C allele, responded to BH(4) administration. No clear correlation was noted between the degree of decrease in serum phenylalanine concentrations in the single- or four-dose tests and specific PAH mutations. The 1-wk test (20 mg/kg of BH(4) per day) is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of BH(4)-responsive PAH deficiency. Responsiveness apparently depends on mutations in the PAH gene causing mild PKU, such as R241C.

Activity of in vitro expressed mutant PAH may predict the patient's phenotype and response to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), the cofactor of PAH.
A robust LC-ESI-MSMS PAH assay for the quantification of phenylalanine and tyrosine was developed. We measured PAH activity a) of the PAH mutations p.Y417C, p.I65T, p.R261Q, p.E280A, p.R158Q, p.R408W, and p.E390G expressed in eukaryotic COS-1 cells; b) in different cell lines (e.g. Huh-7, Hep3B); and c) in liver, brain, and kidney tissue from wild-type and PKU mice.
The PAH assay was linear for phenylalanine and tyrosine (r(2)≥0.99), with a detection limit of 105 nmol/L for Phe and 398 nmol/L for Tyr. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <5.3% and <6.2%, respectively, for the p.R158Q variant in lower tyrosine range. Recovery of tyrosine was 100%. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, the highest PAH activity at standard conditions (1 mmol/L L-Phe; 200 μmol/L BH(4)) was found for the mutant p.Y417C (76%), followed by p.E390G (54%), p.R261Q (43%), p.I65T (33%), p.E280A (15%), p.R158Q (5%), and p.R408W (2%).

However, regular infusions are time-consuming. Utilizing recommended infusion rates, infusion duration is 3h 45min for a patient receiving the standard dose of 20mg/kg, not including additional time needed for preparation of ERT, assessment of vital signs, intravenous access, and post-infusion monitoring. Recent studies have demonstrated increased effectiveness of higher dose of ERT (40mg/kg) in infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), which increases the infusion duration to 6h 36min. Increased infusion durations compound the psychosocial burden on patients and families and potentially further disrupt family activities and obligations. We developed a stepwise infusion rate escalation protocol to administer higher dose ERT safely while decreasing infusion duration, which has been implemented in 15 patients to date. Reported here in detail are five patients with IOPD on 40mg/kg/weekly ERT in whom infusion duration was decreased with individualized, stepwise rate escalation. All patients tolerated rate escalations above the recommended rates without experiencing any infusion associated reactions and experienced a reduction in infusion duration by 1h and 24min with a corresponding increase in reported satisfaction.

28231333,"Ets1 is an essential transcription factor (TF) for several important physiological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Its recognition of the enhancer region of the TCRα gene is enhanced by the cooperative binding of the Runx1-CBFβ heterodimer, with the cancelation of phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition. The detailed mechanism of this interesting cooperativity between Ets1 and the Runx1-CBFβ heterodimer is still largely unclear. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this cooperativity, by using molecular dynamics simulations. Consequently, we detected high flexibility of the loop region between the HI2 and H1 helices of Ets1. Upon Runx1-CBFβ heterodimer binding, this loop transiently adopts various sub-stable conformations in its interactions with the DNA. In addition, a network analysis suggested an allosteric pathway in the molecular assembly and identified some key residues that coincide with previous experimental studies. Our simulations suggest that the cooperative binding of Ets1 and the Runx1-CBFβ heterodimer alters the DNA conformation and induces sub-stable conformations of the HI2-H1 loop of Ets1. This phenomenon increases the flexibility of the regulatory module, including the HI2 helix, and destabilizes the inhibitory form of this module.

For this purpose, the activation intermediate factors IX alpha and IXa alpha were purified after cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 and Arg180-Val181 bonds, respectively. These intermediates were compared for a number of functional properties with factor IXa beta, which is cleaved at both positions. Factor IXa alpha was equal to factor IXa beta in hydrolyzing the synthetic substrate CH3SO2-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (kcat/Km approximately 120 s-1 M-1) but was less efficient in factor X activation. Factor IX alpha was incapable of generating factor Xa but displayed reactivity toward p-nitrophenol p-guanidinobenzoate and the peptide substrate. The catalytic efficiency, however, was 4-fold lower compared with factor IXa alpha and factor IXa beta. Factor IX alpha and factor IXa beta had similar affinity for the inhibitor benzamidine (Ki approximately 2.5 mM), and amidolytic activity of both species was inhibited by Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone and antithrombin III. Unlike factor IXa beta, factor IX alpha was unable to form SDS stable complexes with antithrombin III. Moreover, inhibition of factor IXa beta and factor IX alpha by Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone followed distinct pathways, because factor IX alpha was inhibited in a nonirreversible manner and displayed only minor incorporation of the dansylated inhibitor into its catalytic site. These data demonstrate that the catalytic site of factor IX alpha differs from that of the fully activated factor IXa beta. Factor IX and its derivatives were also compared with regard to complex assembly with factor VIII in direct binding studies employing the immobilized factor VIII light chain. Factor IX alpha and factor IXa beta displayed a 30-fold higher affinity for the factor VIII light chain (Kd approximately 12 nM) than the factor IX zymogen. Factor IXa alpha showed lower affinity (Kd approximately 50 nM) than factor IX alpha and factor IXa beta, which may explain the lower efficiency of factor X activation by factor IXa alpha. Collectively, our data indicate that cleavage of the Arg180-Val181 bond develops full amidolytic activity but results in suboptimal binding to the factor VIII light chain. With regard to cleavage of the Arg145-Ala146 bond, we have demonstrated that this results in the transition of the factor IX zymogen into an enzyme that lacks proteolytic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

We report a 8-year-old male with multiple café-au-lait macules, several lentigines and dysmorphic features that suggest Noonan syndrome initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. However, after a few years of clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, the absence of typical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and the lack of NF1 mutation led us to reconsider the original diagnosis. A new examination of the patient and his similarly affected father, who was initially referred as healthy, led us to suspect LEOPARD syndrome, The diagnosis was then confirmed by the occurrence in both patients of a heterozygous mutation c.1403 C > T, p.(Thr468Met), of PTPN11. Subsequently, the proband was also found to have type-1 Arnold-Chiari malformation in association with syringomyelia.
Our experience suggests that differential clinical diagnosis among RASopathies remains ambiguous and raises doubts on the current diagnostic clinical criteria. In some cases, genetic tests represent the only conclusive proof for a correct diagnosis and, consequently, for establishing individual prognosis and providing adequate follow-up. Thus, molecular testing represents an essential tool in differential diagnosis of RASophaties.

Functional impact on splicing was assessed for intronic mutations. E-cadherin/β-catenin immunohistochemical staining and E-cadherin mRNA quantification using RT-PCR were performed.
In GCs, 4 missense variants (p.G274S; p.A298T; p.T470I; p.A592T), 1 mutation in the 5'UTR (-71C>G) and 1 mutation in the intronic IVS12 (c.1937-13T>C) region were found. First pathogenic effect of p.A298T mutation was predicted by protein 3D modelling. The novel p.G274S mutation showed a no clear functional significance. Moreover, first, intronic IVS12 (c.1937-13T>C) mutation was demonstrated to lead to an aberrant CDH1 transcript with exon 11 deletion. This mutation was found in 2 GCs and in 1 BD. In FDRs, we identified 4 variants: the polymorphic (p.A592T) and 3 mutations in untranslated regions with unidentified functional role except for the 5'UTR (-54G>C) that had been found to decrease CDH1 transcription. In AMAGs, we detected 2 alterations: 1 missense (p.A592T) and 1 novel variant (IVS1 (c.48+7C>T)) without effect on CDH1 splicing.

Overall our study improves upon the current characterization of CDH1 mutations and their functional role in GC and in individuals at risk of GC. Mutations found in untranslated regions and data on splicing effects deserve a particular attention like associated with a reduced E-cadherin amount.

Adding RNA genetic testing (RGT) enhances DGT by clarifying the clinical actionability of hereditary cancer gene variants, thus improving clinicians' ability to accurately apply strategies for cancer risk reduction and treatment.
To evaluate whether RGT is associated with improvement in the diagnostic outcome of DGT and in the delivery of personalized cancer risk management for patients with hereditary cancer predisposition.
Diagnostic study in which patients and/or families with inconclusive variants detected by DGT in genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer sent blood samples for RGT from March 2016 to April 2018. Clinicians who ordered genetic testing and received a reclassification report for these variants were surveyed to assess whether RGT-related variant reclassifications changed clinical management of these patients. To quantify the potential number of tested individuals who could benefit from RGT, a cohort of 307 812 patients who underwent DGT for hereditary cancer were separately queried to identify variants predicted to affect splicing. Data analysis was conducted from March 2016 and September 2018.
Variant reclassification outcomes following RGT, clinical management changes associated with RGT-related variant reclassifications, and the proportion of patients who would likely be affected by a concurrent DGT and RGT multigene panel testing approach.
In total, 93 if 909 eligible families (10.2%) submitted samples for RGT. Evidence from RGT clarified the interpretation of 49 of 56 inconclusive cases (88%) studied; 26 (47%) were reclassified as clinically actionable and 23 (41%) were clarified as benign. Variant reclassifications based on RGT results changed clinical management recommendations for 8 of 18 patients (44%) and 14 of 18 families (78%), based on responses from 18 of 45 clinicians (40%) surveyed. A total of 7265 of 307 812 patients who underwent DGT had likely pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance potentially affecting splicing, indicating that approximately 1 in 43 individuals could benefit from RGT.
In this diagnostic study, conducting RNA testing resolved a substantial proportion of variants of uncertain significance in a cohort of individuals previously tested for cancer predisposition by DGT. Performing RGT might change the diagnostic outcome of at least 1 in 43 patients if performed in all individuals undergoing genetic evaluation for hereditary cancer.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,1,
32017842,"While rare variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) gene can cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY), other variants can be risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. As has been suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines for variant interpretation, functional studies provide strong evidence to classify a variant as pathogenic.
We hypothesized that a functional evaluation can improve the interpretation of the HNF1A variants in our Czech MODY Registry.
We studied 17 HNF1A variants that were identified in 48 individuals (33 female/15 male) from 20 Czech families with diabetes, using bioinformatics in silico tools and functional protein analyses (transactivation, protein expression, DNA binding, and nuclear localization).
Of the 17 variants, 12 variants (p.Lys120Glu, p.Gln130Glu, p.Arg131Pro, p.Leu139Pro, p.Met154Ile, p.Gln170Ter, p.Glu187SerfsTer40, p.Phe215SerfsTer18, p.Gly253Arg, p.Leu383ArgfsTer3, p.Gly437Val, and p.Thr563HisfsTer85) exhibited significantly reduced transcriptional activity or DNA binding (< 40%) and were classified as (likely) pathogenic, 2/17 variants were (likely) benign and 3/17 remained of uncertain significance. Functional analyses allowed for the reclassification of 10/17 variants (59%). Diabetes treatment was improved in 20/29 (69%) carriers of (likely) pathogenic HNF1A variants.
Functional evaluation of the HNF1A variants is necessary to better predict the pathogenic effects and to improve the diagnostic interpretation and treatment, particularly in cases where the cosegregation or family history data are not available or where the phenotype is more diverse and overlaps with other types of diabetes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The ClinGen Hearing Loss Expert Panel collected published data and shared unpublished information from contributing laboratories and clinics regarding the two variants. Functional, computational, allelic, and segregation data were also obtained. Case-control statistical analyses were performed.
The panel reviewed the synthesized information, and classified the p.Met34Thr and p.Val37Ile variants utilizing professional variant interpretation guidelines and professional judgment. We found that p.Met34Thr and p.Val37Ile are significantly overrepresented in hearing loss patients, compared with population controls. Individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for p.Met34Thr or p.Val37Ile typically manifest mild to moderate hearing loss. Several other types of evidence also support pathogenic roles for these two variants.
Resolving controversies in variant classification requires coordinated effort among a panel of international multi-institutional experts to share data, standardize classification guidelines, review evidence, and reach a consensus.

We reviewed all diabetes and hyperinsulinism-associated molecular testing done at the Seattle Children's Molecular Genetics Laboratory from 2009 to 2013. 331 probands were referred to us for molecular genetic sequencing for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM), Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), or Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) during this period. Reportable variants were identified in 115 (35%) patients with 91 variants in one of 6 genes: HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A, ABCC8, KCNJ11, or INS. In addition to identifying 23 novel variants, we identified unusual mechanisms of inheritance, including mosaic and digenic MODY presentations. Re-analysis of all reported variants using more recently available databases led to a change in variant interpretation from the original report in 30% of cases.

This study aimed to assess the genotype-phenotype correlation in the PKU Spanish population and the usefulness in establishing genotype-based predictions of BH4 responsiveness in our population. It involved the molecular characterization of 411 Spanish PKU patients: mild hyperphenylalaninemia non-treated (mild HPA-NT) (34%), mild HPA (8.8%), mild-moderate (20.7%) and classic (36.5%) PKU. BH4 responsiveness was evaluated using a 6R-BH4 loading test. We assessed genotype-phenotype associations and genotype-BH4 responsiveness in our population according to literature and classification of the mutations. The mutational spectrum analysis showed 116 distinct mutations, most missense (70.7%) and located in the catalytic domain (62.9%). The most prevalent mutations were c.1066-11G>A (9.7%), p.Val388Met (6.6%) and p.Arg261Gln (6.3%). Three novel mutations (c.61-13del9, p.Ile283Val and p.Gly148Val) were reported. Although good genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, there was no exact correlation for some genotypes. Among the patients monitored for the 6R-BH4 loading test: 102 were responders (87, carried either one or two BH4-responsive alleles) and 194 non-responders (50, had two non-responsive mutations). More discrepancies were observed in non-responders. Our data reveal a great genetic heterogeneity in our population.

21569298,"Usher syndrome (USH) combines sensorineural deafness with blindness. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. Early diagnosis is critical for adapted educational and patient management choices, and for genetic counseling. To date, nine causative genes have been identified for the three clinical subtypes (USH1, USH2 and USH3). Current diagnostic strategies make use of a genotyping microarray that is based on the previously reported mutations. The purpose of this study was to design a more accurate molecular diagnosis tool.
We sequenced the 366 coding exons and flanking regions of the nine known USH genes, in 54 USH patients (27 USH1, 21 USH2 and 6 USH3).
Biallelic mutations were detected in 39 patients (72%) and monoallelic mutations in an additional 10 patients (18.5%). In addition to biallelic mutations in one of the USH genes, presumably pathogenic mutations in another USH gene were detected in seven patients (13%), and another patient carried monoallelic mutations in three different USH genes. Notably, none of the USH3 patients carried detectable mutations in the only known USH3 gene, whereas they all carried mutations in USH2 genes. Most importantly, the currently used microarray would have detected only 30 of the 81 different mutations that we found, of which 39 (48%) were novel.
Based on these results, complete exon sequencing of the currently known USH genes stands as a definite improvement for molecular diagnosis of this disease, which is of utmost importance in the perspective of gene therapy.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Of the 18 likely pathogenic mutations, nine were novel. Among the USH2 patients, 50 (39%) had one or two likely pathogenic mutations. The most common mutant allele in USH2 patients was E767fs, which was found in 29 patients, including one homozygote. Among the ARRP patients, we found 17 (12%) with one or two likely pathogenic mutations. The most common mutant allele in ARRP patients was C759F and it was found in 10 patients. The C759F allele was also found in two USH2 patients; in neither of them was a change in the other allele found. The second most common mutant allele in both patient groups was L1447fs (found in 6/50 USH2 patients and 6/17 ARRP patients). Of the 50+17=67 patients with identified USH2A mutations, only one mutation in one allele was found in 41+12=53 (79%); the reason for the high proportion of patients with only one identified mutation is obscure.

24728327,"Technological advances coupled with decreasing costs are bringing whole genome and whole exome sequencing closer to routine clinical use. One of the hurdles to clinical implementation is the high number of variants of unknown significance. For cancer-susceptibility genes, the difficulty in interpreting the clinical relevance of the genomic variants is compounded by the fact that most of what is known about these variants comes from the study of highly selected populations, such as cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. The genetic variation in known cancer-susceptibility genes in the general population has not been well characterized to date. To address this gap, we profiled the nonsynonymous genomic variation in 158 genes causally implicated in carcinogenesis using high-quality whole genome sequences from an ancestrally diverse cohort of 681 healthy individuals. We found that all individuals carry multiple variants that may impact cancer susceptibility, with an average of 68 variants per individual. Of the 2,688 allelic variants identified within the cohort, most are very rare, with 75% found in only 1 or 2 individuals in our population. Allele frequencies vary between ancestral groups, and there are 21 variants for which the minor allele in one population is the major allele in another. Detailed analysis of a selected subset of 5 clinically important cancer genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, KRAS, TP53, and PTEN, highlights differences between germline variants and reported somatic mutations. The dataset can serve a resource of genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in 6 ancestry groups, an important foundation for the interpretation of cancer risk from personal genome sequences.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Using this approach, we have also identified 3 novel mutations in cDNA from liver and lymphocytes of two patients. One mutation, detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment, is a C to T transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 10, which resulted in the skipping of exon 11 with the premature termination of RNA translation downstream from exon 12 (-3 IVS10). The other two mutations are missense mutations in exons 10 and 11 (respectively, L333F and E390G).

We describe a new deletion-insertion mutation in the GPIIb gene causing type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia in two siblings of a consanguineous Iranian-Jewish family. The proband's platelets bound more antibodies against the vitronectin receptor-alpha V beta 3 than normal platelets, suggesting a normal GPIIIa (beta 3) gene and a defect in the GPIIb gene. Sequencing of amplified cDNA and genomic DNA fragments showed a 6-bp deletion and 31-bp insertion in exon 25 of the GPIIb gene. The predominant platelet GPIIb mRNA of the proband was a product of the splicing of exon 24 to a cryptic AG acceptor site in the insertion and encoded for deletion of amino acids Leu817-Asn826 and insertion of eight different amino acids. Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with expression vectors containing wild-type GPIIIa cDNA and the mutated GPIIb cDNA failed to produce detectable amounts of GPIIb/IIIa on the surface of the cells. Allele-specific restriction analysis of genomic DNA of family members showed homozygosity for the mutation in the affected siblings, heterozygosity in the parents, and homozygosity for the normal allele in an unaffected sibling. The observed mutation is in a region that is conserved from rodents to humans and has been suggested to be involved in the interaction between GPIIb and GPIIIa when these GPs are complexed in solution.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Allele frequencies of the more common mutations exhibited significant nonrandom distribution in a north/south differentiation. Differences between the west of Scotland and southwestern England may be related to different events in the recent and past histories of their respective populations.

The C670T mutation was present in two unrelated patients in heterozygosity; the effect on enzyme activity was assessed by in vitro expression. COS-1 cells expressing the C670T allele had a twofold higher activity than the negative control cells. The G989A and G2188T point mutations lead to the introduction of premature stop signals that results in truncated forms of alpha glucosidase. The in vitro expression of G2188T allele demonstrated no increment in activity compared to negative control. The frame shifting deletion of nucleotides 828-850 was identified in one patient in heterozygosity. The shift in the reading frame introduces a stop codon 135 nucleotides downstream the deletion junction that results in a truncated protein without catalytic activity. Nested PCR screening showed that the mutation was carried by the mother and was absent in the other members of the family.

Here we study a pedigree containing cases of autosomal dominant deafness and have identified a mutation in the gene encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) that segregates with the profound deafness in the family. Cx26 mutations resulting in premature stop codons were also found in three autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineuronal deafness pedigrees, genetically linked to chromosome 13q11-12 (DFNB1), where the Cx26 gene is localized.

We report on two affected members of a non-consanguineous Caucasian family, including a classical infantile-onset patient with severe cardiomyopathy (IO) and his paternal grandmother with the adult-onset (AO) form. Two compound heterozygous sequence variants of the GAA gene were identified in each patient by mutation analyses (IO=c.1211A>G and c.1798C>T; AO=c.1211A>G and c.692+5G>T). For this study, the biochemical phenotype resulting from the missense mutation c.1211A>G in exon 8, which converts a highly conserved aspartate to glycine (p.Asp404Gly), was of specific interest because it had not been reported previously. Western blotting revealed a robust expression of all GAA isoforms in quadriceps muscle of both patients (fully CRIM positive), while enzymatic activity was 3.6% (IO) and 6.6% (AO) of normal controls. To further validate these findings, the c.1211A>G sequence variant was introduced in wild type GAA cDNA and over-expressed in HEK293T cells. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses confirmed that the mutation does not affect processing or expression of GAA protein, but rather impairs enzyme function. Similar results were reported for c.1798C>T (p.Arg600Cys), which further supports the biochemical phenotype observed in IO. The third mutation (c.692+5G>T, in intron 3) was predicted to affect normal splicing of the GAA mRNA, and qPCR indeed verified a 4-fold lower mRNA expression in AO. It is concluded that the novel sequence variant c.1211A>G results in full CRIM but significantly lower GAA activity, which in combination with c.1798C>T leads to infantile-onset Pompe disease. We surmise that the difference in disease severity between the two family members in this study is due to a milder effect of the intronic mutation c.692+5G>T (vs. c.1798C>T) on phenotype, partially preserving GAA activity and delaying onset in the proband (paternal grandmother).",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

In both fibroblast cultures the PTPN11 mutation was present, and no additional mutation could be detected. We discuss the various possible explanations for this phenotype, which include the possibility of coincidence; revertant mosaicism; silencing of a second PTPN11 mutation; gene(s) located on a sex chromosome influencing the phenotype; and epigenetic influences. We favor that the co-occurrence of a sex chromosome mosaicism and mosaicism for skin symptoms in a single patient with LEOPARD syndrome is coincidence, but that mosaicism for LEOPARD skin symptoms in itself may well be more frequent and needs additional studies.

The need for a detailed catalog of local variability motivated the whole-exome sequencing of 267 unrelated individuals, representative of the healthy Spanish population. Like in other studies, a considerable number of rare variants were found (almost one-third of the described variants). There were also relevant differences in allelic frequencies in polymorphic variants, including ∼10,000 polymorphisms private to the Spanish population. The allelic frequencies of variants conferring susceptibility to complex diseases (including cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and other pathologies) were overall similar to those of other populations. However, the trend is the opposite for variants linked to Mendelian and rare diseases (including several retinal degenerative dystrophies and cardiomyopathies) that show marked frequency differences between populations. Interestingly, a correspondence between differences in allelic frequencies and disease prevalence was found, highlighting the relevance of frequency differences in disease risk. These differences are also observed in variants that disrupt known drug binding sites, suggesting an important role for local variability in population-specific drug resistances or adverse effects. We have made the Spanish population variant server web page that contains population frequency information for the complete list of 170,888 variant positions we found publicly available (http://spv.babelomics.org/), We show that it if fundamental to determine population-specific variant frequencies to distinguish real disease associations from population-specific polymorphisms.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

The presence of these two variations in such an important gene could probably affect the ATP synthesis in the studied patient.

Mutations in GJB2 and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 12S rRNA are the most common molecular etiology for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL). The mutation spectra of these genes vary among different ethnic groups.
To add the molecular etiologic information of hearing loss in the Chinese population, a total of 658 unrelated patients with NSHL from Jiangsu Province of China were selected for mutational screening including GJB2 and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes using PCR and DNA sequencing technology. As for controls, 462 normal-hearing individuals were collected.
A total of 9 pathogenic mutations in the GJB2 and 7 pathogenic mutations in the 12S rRNA gene were identified. Of all patients, 70 had monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutation in the heterozygous state, 94 carried two confirmed pathogenic mutations including 79 homozygotes and 15 compound heterozygotes. The 235delC appears to be the most common deafness-causing GJB2 mutation (102/658, 15.50% ). No mutations or variants in the GJB2 exon1 and basal promoter region were found. In these patients, 4 subjects carried the m.1494C > T mutation (0.61% ) and 39 subjects harbored the m.1555A > G mutation (5.93% ) in mtDNA 12S rRNA gene.

The combined use of the STR, VNTR and XmnI polymorphic systems for the PAH gene resulted in a discriminant distribution of haplotypes among normal and mutant chromosomes and suggests its potential usefulness for future diagnostic applications in Costa Rican PKU kindreds.

19687512,"Investigation of 3 families with bleeding symptoms demonstrated a defect in the collagen-binding activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in association with a normal VWF multimeric pattern. Genetic analysis showed affected persons to be heterozygous for mutations in the A3 domain of VWF: S1731T, W1745C, and S1783A. One person showed compound heterozygosity for W1745C and R760H. W1745C and S1783A have not been reported previously. The mutations were reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis and mutant VWF expressed in HEK293T cells. Collagen-binding activity measured by immunosorbent assay varied according to collagen type: W1745C and S1783A were associated with a pronounced binding defect to both type I and type III collagen, whereas the principal abnormality in S1731T patients was a reduction in binding to type I collagen only. The multimer pattern and distribution of mutant proteins were indistinguishable from wild-type recombinant VWF, confirming that the defect in collagen binding resulted from the loss of affinity at the binding site and not impairment of high-molecular-weight multimer formation. Our findings demonstrate that mutations causing an abnormality in the binding of VWF to collagen may contribute to clinically significant bleeding symptoms. We propose that isolated collagen-binding defects are classified as a distinct subtype of von Willebrand disease.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Clinically, patients with the severe infantile form of GSD II have muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy eventually leading to death before the age of two years. Patients with the juvenile or the adult form of GSD II present with myopathy with a slow progression over several years or decades. Apart from a common base substitution in intron1, designated IVS1(-13T-->G) and resulting in the aberrant splicing of exon 2, the other mutations recently discovered in the GAA gene are rare and often unique to single patients. In this paper, we identified a two-base frameshift deletion in three unrelated adult-onset GSD II patients. This small deletion lies in the first coding exon (exon 2) and results in a premature stop codon at the very 5' end of the coding sequence of the GAA gene. The three patients were compound heterozygotes and two of them had the common IVS1(-13G-->T) mutation on the second allele. We speculate that this novel deletion may be relatively frequent among French patients, possibly leading to the severe infantile phenotype of GSD II if it occurs in homozygous form.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported.
From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients ≤ 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy.
Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS, respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance.
In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was confirmed in 12 patients (18%). HCS identification provides insight for improved and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for family members.

Characterize PKU genotype and phenotype seen in Chilean PKU patients.
We studied the PAH gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and/or sequencing techniques to identify pathogenic mutations in 71 PKU subjects. We classified the phenotype according to Guldberg predicted value.
We identified 26 different mutations in 134 of the 142 alleles studied (94.4%), 88.7% of the subjects had biallelic pathogenic mutations while 11.3% had only one pathogenic mutation identified. Compound heterozygous represented 85.9% of the cases. Exon 7 included the majority of mutations (26.9%) and 50% of mutations were missense.

Both disorders are recessive, and yet only one mutated SLC26A4 allele, or no mutations, are identified in many cases. Here we present the genetic characterization of 105 Spanish patients from 47 families with PS or non-syndromic EVA and 20 families with recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, which segregated with the DFNB4 locus. In this cohort, two causative SLC26A4 mutations could be characterized in 18 families (27%), whereas a single mutated allele was found in a patient with unilateral hearing loss and EVA in the same ear. In all, 24 different causative mutations were identified, including eight novel mutations. The novel p.Q514K variant was the most prevalent mutation in SLC26A4, accounting for 17% (6/36) of the mutated alleles identified in this study, deriving from a founder effect. We also characterized a novel multiexon 14 kb deletion spanning from intron 3 to intron 6 (g.8091T_22145Cdel).

12729737,"Specific recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is governed by sets of aminoacylation identity elements, well defined for numerous prokaryotic systems and eukaryotic cytosolic systems. Only restricted information is available for aminoacylation of human mitochondrial tRNAs, despite their particularities linked to the non-classical structures of the tRNAs and their involvement in a growing number of human neurodegenerative disorders linked to mutations in the corresponding tRNA genes. A major difficulty to be overcome is the preparation of active in vitro transcripts enabling a rational mutagenic analysis, as is currently performed for classical tRNAs. Here, structural and aminoacylation properties of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Leu(UUR)) are presented. Solution probing using a combination of enzymatic and chemical tools revealed only partial folding into an L-shaped structure, with an acceptor branch but with a floppy anticodon branch. Optimization of aminoacylation conditions allowed charging of up to 75% of molecules, showing that, despite its partially relaxed structure, in vitro transcribed tRNA(Leu(UUR)) is able to adapt to the synthetase. In addition, mutational analysis demonstrates that the discriminator base as well as residue A14 are important leucine identity elements. Thus, human mitochondrial leucylation is dependent on rules similar to those that apply in Escherichia coli. The impact of a subset of pathology-related mutations on aminoacylation and on tRNA structure, has been explored. These variants do not show significant structural rearrangements and either do not affect aminoacylation (mutations T3250C, T3271C, C3303T) or lead to marked effects. Interestingly, two variants with a mutation at the same position (A3243G and A3243T) lead to markedly different losses in aminoacylation efficiencies (tenfold and 300-fold, respectively).",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Atrioventricular septal defects and coarctation of the aorta occur in 15% and 9%, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine if PTPN11 mutations exist in non-syndromic patients with these two relevant forms of congenital heart disease. The 15 coding PTPN11 exons and their intron boundaries from subjects with atrioventricular septal defects (n = 24) and coarctation of the aorta (n = 157) were analyzed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced if abnormal. One subject with an atrioventricular septal defect but no other known medical problems had a c.127C > T transition in exon 2, predicting a p.L43F substitution. This mutation affected the phosphotyrosine-binding region in the N-terminal src homology 2 domain and was close to a Noonan syndrome mutation (p.T42A). An otherwise healthy patient with aortic coarctation had a silent c.540C > T change in exon 5 corresponding to p.D180D. Our study showed that PTPN11 mutations are rarely found in two isolated forms of congenital heart disease that commonly occur in Noonan syndrome. The p.L43F mutation belongs to a rare class of PTPN11 mutations altering the phosphotyrosine-binding region. These mutations are not predicted to alter the autoinhibition of the PTPN11 protein product, SHP-2, which is the mechanism for the vast majority of mutations causing Noonan syndrome.

Loss-of-function mutations in the PTEN gene are frequent in human cancer and in the germline of patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs). In addition, PTEN is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although no functional information on these mutations is available. Here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human PTEN using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. Ala-scanning mutagenesis at the catalytic loops of PTEN outlined the critical role of residues within the P-catalytic loop for PIP(3) phosphatase activity in vivo. PTEN mutations that mimic the P-catalytic loop of mammalian PTEN-like proteins (TPTE, TPIP, tensins and auxilins) affected PTEN function variably, whereas tumor- or PHTS-associated mutations targeting the PTEN P-loop produced complete loss of function. Conversely, Ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the WPD- and TI-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. Interestingly, a tumor-related D92N mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that the PTEN Asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. The analysis of a panel of ASD-associated hereditary PTEN mutations revealed that most of them did not substantially abrogate PTEN activity in vivo, whereas most of PHTS-associated mutations did. Our findings reveal distinctive functional patterns among PTEN mutations found in tumors and in the germline of PHTS and ASD patients, which could be relevant for therapy.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Here, we modeled three sentinel mutant alleles of PTEN identified in patients with Cowden syndrome and show that the nonsense Pten(4-5) and missense Pten(C124R) and Pten(G129E) alleles lacking lipid phosphatase activity cause similar developmental abnormalities but distinct tumor spectra with varying severity and age of onset. Allele-specific differences may be accounted for by loss of function for Pten(4-5), hypomorphic function for Pten(C124R), and gain of function for Pten(G129E).

Further analysis with additional markers now identifies several recombinants which narrow the candidate region to approximately 5 cM, encompassed by markers D13S141 and D13S232 and including several ESTs and candidate genes, including the connexin26 (GJB2) gene. Analysis of PCR products from our affected patients' DNA shows two frameshift mutations in the connexin26 gene. Deletion of a G within a stretch of six Gs at position 35 of the GJB2 cDNA (mutation 35delG) leads to premature chain termination and is present in 63% of NSRD chromosomes, demonstrating linkage to chromosome 13. Deletion of a T at position 167 of GJB2 (mutation 167delT), also resulting in premature chain termination, was detected in another patient. Four neutral sequence polymorphisms were also identified. These findings are in agreement with a recent study showing that mutations in the connexin26 gene are associated with genetic forms of deafness in three Pakistani families and that GJB2 is DFNB1. Connexin26 is a member of a large family of proteins involved in formation of gap junctions, which are involved in electrical synapses and the direct transfer of small molecules and ionic currents between neighboring cells.

Echocardiographic studies including Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) were performed in a genotyped HCM population with beta-myosin heavy chain (beta -MHC) mutations. Genotype (+) individuals with LVH (G+/LVH+; n=18) and genotype (+) individuals without LVH (G+/LVH-; n=18) were compared with normal control subjects (n=36). Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was significantly higher in both genotype (+) groups (75+/-5% and 71+/-6%, respectively, versus 64+/- 5% in control subjects; P<0.0001). Mean early diastolic myocardial velocities (Ea) were significantly lower in both genotype (+) subgroups, irrespective of LVH (P<0.02). However, there was substantial overlap in Ea velocities between the G+/LVH- and control groups.

Abnormalities of diastolic function assessed by Doppler tissue imaging precede the development of LVH in individuals with HCM caused by beta -MHC mutations.

One mutation eliminates the BamHI site in exon 7 and the other eliminates the HindIII site in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. They were suspected because of deviating restriction fragment patterns and confirmed by amplification, via the polymerase chain reaction, of exon 7 and exon 11, respectively, followed by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme. Direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 7 revealed a G/C to T/A transversion at the first base of codon 272, substituting a GGA glycine codon for a UGA stop codon. Direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 11 revealed a deletion of codon 364, a CTT leucine codon. The exon 7 mutation can be expected to result in a truncated protein and the exon 11 mutation in the elimination of an amino acid in the catalytic region of the enzyme. A patient who is a compound heterozygote for these two mutations has classical phenylketonuria. It is concluded that each of the two mutations leads to a profound loss of enzymatic activity.

Surgical castration.
The mean patient age was 45.8 years. Fourteen patients (11%) carried a BRCA mutations, and 22 (17%) carried another germline or acquired mutation, including multiple variants of uncertain significance. There was wide variation in surgical approach. Sixty-five patients (51%) underwent pelvic washings, and 43 (35%) underwent concurrent hysterectomy. Other concomitant procedures included midurethral sling placement, appendectomy, and hysteroscopy. Three patients experienced complications (transfusion, wound cellulitis, and vaginal cuff dehiscence). Thirteen patients (10%) had ovarian pathology detected on analysis of the surgical specimen, including metastatic tumor, serous cystadenomas, endometriomas, and Brenner tumor. Eight patients (6%) had Fallopian tube pathology, including 3 serous tubal intraepithelial cancers. Among the 44 uterine specimens, 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma and 1 multifocal endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia were noted. Regarding the entire study population, the number of patients meeting our study criteria and seen by gynecologic surgeons in the FPRN for oophorectomy increased by nearly 400% from 2013 to 2015.
Since publication of the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial data, bilateral oophorectomy has been recommended for some women with premenopausal breast cancer to facilitate breast cancer treatment with aromatase inhibitors. These women may be at elevated risk for occult abdominal pathology compared with the general population. Gynecologic surgeons often perform castration oophorectomy in patients with breast cancer as an increasing number of oncologists are using aromatase inhibitors to treat premenopausal breast cancer. Our data suggest that other abdominal/pelvic cancers, precancerous conditions, and previously unrecognized metastatic disease are not uncommon findings in this patient population. Gynecologists serving this patient population may consider a careful abdominal survey, pelvic washings, endometrial sampling, and serial sectioning of fallopian tube specimens for a thorough evaluation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
30745422,"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a cancer syndrome associated with variants in E-cadherin (CDH1), diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. There is considerable heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations. This study aimed to determine associations between CDH1 germline variant status and clinical phenotypes of HDGC.
One hundred and fifty-two HDGC families, including six previously unreported families, were identified. CDH1 gene-specific guidelines released by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) CDH1 Variant Curation Expert Panel were applied for pathogenicity classification of truncating, missense and splice site CDH1 germline variants. We evaluated ORs between location of truncating variants of CDH1 and incidence of colorectal cancer, breast cancer and cancer at young age (gastric cancer at <40 or breast cancer <50 years of age).
Frequency of truncating germline CDH1 variants varied across functional domains of the E-cadherin receptor gene and was highest in linker (0.05785 counts/base pair; p=0.0111) and PRE regions (0.10000; p=0.0059). Families with truncating CDH1 germline variants located in the PRE-PRO region were six times more likely to have family members affected by colorectal cancer (OR 6.20, 95% CI 1.79 to 21.48; p=0.004) compared with germline variants in other regions. Variants in the intracellular E-cadherin region were protective for cancer at young age (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64; p=0.0071) and in the linker regions for breast cancer (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.99; p=0.0493). Different CDH1 genotypes were associated with different intracellular signalling activation levels including different p-ERK, p-mTOR and β-catenin levels in early submucosal T1a lesions of HDGC families with different CDH1 variants.
Type and location of CDH1 germline variants may help to identify families at increased risk for concomitant cancers that might benefit from individualised surveillance and intervention strategies.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,1,
11214902,"An A-->T substitution in cDNA nucleotide 1197 (c.1197A/T) of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene has been regarded as a silent mutation, because both the wild-type (GUA) and the mutant (GUU) alleles encode a valine residue at codon 399 (V399 V). The nucleotide c.1197 is located at the 3'-end of exon 11at position -3 of the exon-intron junction. To explore whether the substitution exerts any effects on the processing of the PAH mRNA, illegitimate PAH transcripts from lymphoblast cultures of a phenylketonuria (PKU) patient heterozygous for c.1197A/T were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction following reverse-transcription (RT-PCR). mRNAs with an exon 11 deletion were revealed. Furthermore, by using an R408 W mutation in the paternal allele as a marker, sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products indicates that virtually all PAH transcripts from the maternal allele with the c. 1197A/T substitution do not contain exon 11. To address whether this substitution is the main determinant for exon skipping, PAH minigenes with or without the substitution were constructed and transfected to a human hepatoma cell line. Analysis of the transcription products by S1 nuclease mapping clearly indicated that such exon 11 skipping was directly associated with the c.1197A/T substitution. Thus, this study demonstrates that the c.1197A/T substitution in the PAH gene is not just a neutral polymorphism but a mutation that induces post-transcriptional skipping of exon 11 leading to a PKU phenotype.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
26243863,"The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified HER2 somatic mutations and gene amplification in 7% of patients with colorectal cancer. Introduction of the HER2 mutations S310F, L755S, V777L, V842I, and L866M into colon epithelial cells increased signaling pathways and anchorage-independent cell growth, indicating that they are activating mutations. Introduction of these HER2 activating mutations into colorectal cancer cell lines produced resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab by sustaining MAPK phosphorylation. HER2 mutants are potently inhibited by low nanomolar doses of the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and afatinib. HER2 gene sequencing of 48 cetuximab-resistant, quadruple (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA) wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) identified 4 PDXs with HER2 mutations. HER2-targeted therapies were tested on two PDXs. Treatment with a single HER2-targeted drug (trastuzumab, neratinib, or lapatinib) delayed tumor growth, but dual HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced regression of these HER2-mutated PDXs.
HER2 activating mutations cause EGFR antibody resistance in colorectal cell lines, and PDXs with HER2 mutations show durable tumor regression when treated with dual HER2-targeted therapy. These data provide a strong preclinical rationale for clinical trials targeting HER2 activating mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
24130151,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutational inactivation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Missense mutations are the most common PAH mutation type detected in PKU patients worldwide. We performed PAH mutation analysis in 27 suspected Indian PKU families (including 7 from our previous study) followed by structure and function analysis of specific missense and splice/insertion-deletion/nonsense mutations, respectively. Of the 27 families, disease-causing mutations were detected in 25. A total of 20 different mutations were identified of which 7 ""unique"" mutations accounted for 13 of 25 mutation positive families. The unique mutations detected exclusively in Indian PKU patients included three recurrent mutations detected in three families each. The 20 mutations included only 5 missense mutations in addition to 5 splice, 4 each nonsense and insertion-deletion mutations, a silent variant in coding region and a 3'UTR mutation. One deletion and two nonsense mutations were characterized to confirm significant reduction in mutant transcript levels possibly through activation of nonsense mediated decay. All missense mutations affected conserved amino acid residues and sequence and structure analysis suggested significant perturbations in the enzyme activity of respective mutant proteins. This is probably the first report of identification of a significantly low proportion of missense PAH mutations from PKU families and together with the presence of a high proportion of splice, insertion-deletion, and nonsense mutations, points to a unique PAH mutation profile in Indian PKU patients.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
32125626,"Pompe disease, a rare, autosomal, recessive, inherited, lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene leading to a deficiency of the lysosomal GAA enzyme. Some GAA mutations eliminate all enzymatic activities, causing severe infantile Pompe disease; others allow residual GAA activity and lead to middle adulthood forms. Here, we report a cohort of 12 patients, belonging to 11 unrelated families, with infantile Pompe disease. The mutational analysis of GAA gene revealed a novel c.1494G > A (p.Trp498X) mutation in one patient and three known mutatio,ns including the c.1497G > A (p.Trp499X) mutation, in two patients, the c.1927G > A (p.Gly643Arg) mutation in one patient and the common c.236_246del (p.Pro79ArgfsX13) mutation in eight patients. The high prevalence of c.236_246del mutation in our cohort (58%) was supported by the existence of a common founder ancestor that was confirmed by its segregation of similar SNPs haplotype, including four intragenic SNPs of GAA gene. In addition, a 3D structure model and a docking were generated for the mutant p.Gly643Arg using the crystal structure of human GAA as template and the 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-glucopyranoside as substrate. The results showed that the arginine at position 643 caused electrostatic changes in neighboring regions, leading to the repulsion between the amino acids located in the catalytic cavity of the GAA enzyme, thus restricting access to its substrate. These structural defects could cause the impairment of the transport and maturation previously reported for p.Gly643Arg mutation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
26911350,"Breast and/or ovarian cancer (BOC) are among the most frequently diagnosed forms of hereditary cancers and leading cause of death in India. This emphasizes on the need for a cost-effective method for early detection of these cancers. We sequenced 141 unrelated patients and families with BOC using the TruSight Cancer panel, which includes 13 genes strongly associated with risk of inherited BOC. Multi-gene sequencing was done on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Genetic variations were identified using the Strand NGS software and interpreted using the StrandOmics platform. We were able to detect pathogenic mutations in 51 (36.2%) cases, out of which 19 were novel mutations. When we considered familial breast cancer cases only, the detection rate increased to 52%. When cases were stratified based on age of diagnosis into three categories, ⩽40 years, 40-50 years and >50 years, the detection rates were higher in the first two categories (44.4% and 53.4%, respectively) as compared with the third category, in which it was 26.9%. Our study suggests that next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panels increase the sensitivity of mutation detection and help in identifying patients with a high risk of developing cancer as compared with sequential tests of individual genes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
20883402,"Five familial cases exhibited ephelides-like multiple lentigines, and we examined three of them, a mother and two sons. All three patients presented with small dark-brown maculae on the face and neck and electrocardiographic abnormalities. These findings sufficed to fulfill the criteria for LEOPARD syndrome (multiple lentigines syndrome), although they lacked five of seven major clinical features. However, the family members presented with a webbed neck and pectus excavatum, which are more frequently seen in Turner or Noonan syndrome. Histological examination of the lentigines revealed slightly elongated rete ridges, a hyperpigmented basal layer, and melanophages in the papillary dermis. Direct sequencing of the patients' genomic DNA revealed that all three had a consistent missense mutation [c.1403C > T (p.T468M)] in the PTPN11 gene, confirming LEOPARD syndrome with an atypical phenotype. It was suggested that LEOPARD syndrome shows a diverse phenotype but its diagnosis can be verified by mutation analysis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
10196714,"A high degree of molecular heterogeneneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus was established by examining RFLP haplotypes and PAH mutations in the families of 13 Egyptians with phenylketenouria (PKU). Thirteen different haplotypes were unequivocally determined in these kindreds. Haplotypes 1.8, 3.9, 4.3, 7.8, 22.11, 27.6, and 52.8 were found segregating with normal chromosomes, whilst haplotypes 1.8, 5.9, 23.8, 32.8, the newly assigned 73.9, and two as yet incomplete but novel haplotypes were found segregating with the mutant chromosomes. There was no particular preference for a single haplotype among normal or mutant chromosomes. Nine different mutations were also identified among the 26 alleles. IVS 10nt11g (8/26), IVS 2nt5g-c (4/26), R261Q (3/26), R176X (2/26), Y206D (2/26), S231P (2/26), Y198fs [593-614del22bp]; (2/26), G46fs [136/137delG]; (1/26), and E178G (1/26). Six of these mutations (IVS 2nt5g-c, R176X, Y198fs, R261Q, S231P, and IVS 10nt11g) are common to other Mediterranean populations. Two mutations not previously reported in the Mediterranean basin were also observed (Y206D and G46fs). These intriguing preliminary findings confirm IVS 10nt11g as a major mutation among Mediterranean mutations and demonstrate the need for a more comprehensive study of Arab populations to confirm the uniqueness of the two novel mutations to the Egyptian population.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
29281825,"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME) are epileptogenic neurodevelopmental malformations caused by mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Deep sequencing of these genes in FCD/HME brain tissue identified an etiology in 27 of 66 cases (41%). Radiographically indistinguishable lesions are caused by somatic activating mutations in AKT3, MTOR, and PIK3CA and germline loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5, NPRL2, and TSC1/2, including TSC2 mutations in isolated HME demonstrating a ""two-hit"" model. Mutations in the same gene cause a disease continuum from FCD to HME to bilateral brain overgrowth, reflecting the progenitor cell and developmental time when the mutation occurred. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated mTOR activation in neurons in all lesions. Conditional Pik3ca activation in the mouse cortex showed that mTOR activation in excitatory neurons and glia, but not interneurons, is sufficient for abnormal cortical overgrowth. These data suggest that mTOR activation in dorsal telencephalic progenitors, in some cases specifically the excitatory neuron lineage, causes cortical dysplasia.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
12807882,"Core-binding factors (CBFs) are a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors that play critical roles in hematopoiesis and in the development of bone, stomach epithelium, and proprioceptive neurons. Mutations in CBF genes are found in leukemias, bone disorders, and gastric cancer. CBFs consist of a DNA-binding CBF alpha subunit and a non-DNA-binding CBF beta subunit. DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBF beta are mediated by the Runt domain in CBF alpha. Here we report an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the Runt domain that targeted amino acids identified by structural studies to reside at the DNA or CBF beta interface, as well as amino acids mutated in human disease. We determined the energy contributed by each of the DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain to DNA binding both in the absence and presence of CBF beta.

On molecular level more than 350 mutations in the PAH gene are known to date, which in different genotype combinations could account for biochemical and clinical variability. Mutations located in exon 3 coding for a part of the regulatory domain of the PAH enzyme cause classical PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). We describe the phenotypic effects of seven mutations in exon 3 of the PAH gene (R68G, R68S, R71H, S87R, P89S, I95F, and A104D).

All 51 patients harboured the typical features of Rasopathy syndromes. Thirty-five mutations were identified in the examined patients (22 in PTPN11, two in SOS1, one in RIT1, one in SHOC2, two in HRAS, three in BRAF, two in MAP2K1 and two in the NF1 gene). Two of them (p.Gly392Glu in the BRAF gene and p.Gln164Lys in the MAP2K1 gene) were novel with a potentially pathogenic effect on the structure of these proteins. Statistically significant differences in the presence of pulmonary stenosis (63.64% vs. 23.81%, P = 0.013897) and cryptorchidism (76.47% vs. 30%, P = 0.040224) were identified as the result of comparison of the prevalence of phenotypic features in patients with the phenotype of Noonan syndrome and mutation in the PTPN11 gene, with the prevalence of the same features in patients without PTPN11 mutation. Cryptorchidism as a statistically significant feature in our patients with PTPN11 mutation was not reported as significant in other European countries (Germany, Italy and Greece).

31558572,"Over 150 mutations in theSCN2Agene, which encodes the neuronal Nav1.2 protein, have been implicated in human epilepsy cases. Of these, R1882Q and R853Q are two of the most commonly reported mutations. This study utilized voltage-clamp electrophysiology to characterize the biophysical effects of the R1882Q and R853Q mutations on the hNav1.2 channel, including their effects on resurgent current and gating pore current, which are not typically investigated in the study of Nav1.2 channel mutations. HEK cells transiently transfected with DNA encoding either wild-type (WT) or mutant hNav1.2 revealed that the R1882Q mutation induced a gain-of-function phenotype, including slowed fast inactivation, depolarization of the voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased persistent current. In this model system, the R853Q mutation primarily produced loss-of-function effects, including reduced transient current amplitude and density, hyperpolarization of the voltage dependence of inactivation, and decreased persistent current. The presence of a Navβ4 peptide (KKLITFILKKTREK-OH) in the pipette solution induced resurgent currents, which were increased by the R1882Q mutation and decreased by the R853Q mutation. Further study of the R853Q mutation inXenopusoocytes indicated a reduced surface expression and revealed a robust gating pore current at negative membrane potentials, a function absent in the WT channel. This not only shows that different epileptogenic point mutations in hNav1.2 have distinct biophysical effects on the channel, but also illustrates that individual mutations can have complex consequences that are difficult to identify using conventional analyses. Distinct mutations may, therefore, require tailored pharmacotherapies in order to eliminate seizures.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
26270727,"The practice of genetic testing for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) is rapidly evolving owing to the recent introduction of multigene panels. While these tests may identify 40% to 50% more individuals with hereditary cancer gene mutations than does testing for BRCA1/2 alone, whether finding such mutations will alter clinical management is unknown.
To define the potential clinical effect of multigene panel testing for HBOC in a clinically representative cohort.
Observational study of patients seen between 2001 and 2014 in 3 large academic medical centers. We prospectively enrolled 1046 individuals who were appropriate candidates for HBOC evaluation and who lacked BRCA1/2 mutations.
We carried out multigene panel testing on all participants, then determined the clinical actionability, if any, of finding non-BRCA1/2 mutations in these and additional comparable individuals.
We evaluated the likelihood of (1) a posttest management change and (2) an indication for additional familial testing, considering gene-specific consensus management guidelines, gene-associated cancer risks, and personal and family history.
Among 1046 study participants, 40 BRCA1/2-negative patients (3.8%; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.2%) harbored deleterious mutations, most commonly in moderate-risk breast and ovarian cancer genes (CHEK2, ATM, and PALB2) and Lynch syndrome genes. Among these and an additional 23 mutation-positive individuals enrolled from our clinics, most of the mutations (92%) were consistent with the spectrum of cancer(s) observed in the patient or family, suggesting that these results are clinically significant. Among all 63 mutation-positive patients, additional disease-specific screening and/or prevention measures beyond those based on personal and family history alone would be considered for most (33 [52%] of 63; 95% CI, 40.3%-64.2%). Furthermore, additional familial testing would be considered for those with first-degree relatives (42 [72%] of 58; 95% CI, 59.8%-82.2%) based on potential management changes for mutation-positive relatives. This clinical effect was not restricted to a few of the tested genes because most identified genes could change clinical management for some patients.
In a clinically representative cohort, multigene panel testing for HBOC risk assessment yielded findings likely to change clinical management for substantially more patients than does BRCA1/2 testing alone. Multigene testing in this setting is likely to alter near-term cancer risk assessment and management recommendations for mutation-affected individuals across a broad spectrum of cancer predisposition genes.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Molecular diagnosis of USH patients is important for disease management. Few studies have tried to find the genetic cause of USH in Chinese patients. This study was designed to determine the mutation spectrum of Chinese USH patients.
We applied next generation sequencing to characterize the mutation spectrum in 67 independent Chinese families with at least one member diagnosed with USH. Blood was collected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. This cohort is one of the largest USH cohorts reported. We utilized customized panel and whole exome sequencing, variant analysis, Sanger validation and segregation tests to find disease causing mutations in these families.
We identified biallelic disease causing mutations in known USH genes in 70 % (49) of our patients. As has been previously reported, MYO7A is the most frequently mutated gene in our USH type I patients while USH2A is the most mutated gene in our USH type II patients. In addition, we identify mutations in CLRN1, DFNB31, GPR98 and PCDH15 for the first time in Chinese USH patients. Together, mutations in CLRN1, DNFB31, GPR98 and PCDH15 account for 11.4 % of disease in our cohort. Interestingly, although the spectrum of disease genes is quite similar between our Chinese patient cohort and other patient cohorts from different (and primarily Caucasian) ethnic backgrounds, the mutations themselves are dramatically different. In particular, 76 % (52/68) of alleles found in this study have never been previously reported. Interestingly, we observed a strong enrichment for severe protein truncating mutations expected to have severe functional consequence on the protein in USH II patients compared to the reported mutation spectrum in RP patients, who often carry partial protein truncating mutations.
Our study provides the first comprehensive genetic characterization of a large collection of Chinese USH patients. Up to 90 % of USH patients have disease caused by mutations in known USH disease genes. By combining NGS-based molecular diagnosis and patient clinical information, a more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and personalized treatment of USH patients can be achieved.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Developing regions report a higher number of sporadic cases, but there are only a few local studies related to hereditary cases of gastric cancer in Brazil to confirm this fact. CDH1 germline mutations have been described both in familial and sporadic cases, but there is only one recent molecular description of individuals from Brazil. In this study we performed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to assess CDH1 germline mutations in individuals who match the clinical criteria for Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC), or who exhibit very early diagnosis of gastric cancer. Among five probands we detected CDH1 germline mutations in two cases (40%). The mutation c.1023T > G was found in a HDGC family and the mutation c.1849G > A, which is nearly exclusive to African populations, was found in an early-onset case of gastric adenocarcinoma. The mutations described highlight the existence of gastric cancer cases caused by CDH1 germline mutations in northern Brazil, although such information is frequently ignored due to the existence of a large number of environmental factors locally.

Mutations in the gene are responsible for the enzyme deficiency, which leads to the intralysosomal storage of the partially degraded glycosaminoglycans dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Molecular characterization of MPS I patients has resulted in the identification of over 70 distinct mutations in the IDUA gene. The high degree of molecular heterogeneity reflects the wide clinical variability observed in MPS I patients. Six novel mutations, c.1087C>T (p.R363C), c.1804T>A (p.F602I), c.793G>C, c.712T>A (p.L238Q), c.1727+2T>A, and c.1269C>G (p.S423R), in a total of 14 different mutations, and 13 different polymorphic changes, including the novel c.246C>G (p.H82Q), were identified in a cohort of 10 MPS I patients enrolled in a clinical trial of enzyme-replacement therapy. Five novel amino acid substitutions and c.236C>T (p.A79V) were engineered into the wild-type IDUA cDNA and expressed. A p.G265R read-through mutation, arising from the c.793G>C splice mutation, was also expressed. Each mutation reduced IDUA protein and activity levels to varying degrees with the processing of many of the mutant forms also affected by IDUA. The varied properties of the expressed mutant forms of IDUA reflect the broad range of biochemical and clinical phenotypes of the 10 patients in this study. IDUA kinetic data derived from each patient's cultured fibroblasts, in combination with genotype data, was used to predict disease severity. Finally, residual IDUA protein concentration in cultured fibroblasts showed a weak correlation to the degree of immune response to enzyme-replacement therapy in each patient.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Most of them were of prelingual onset (82 %) and 27 % were cochlear implanted. Variation of sequences was detected in 171 of the 474 patients (36 %). Overall, 43 different sequence variations were identified in GJB2 and GJB6. Four of them are reported for the first time in GJB2: c.233dupG, p.Ala78Ser, p.Val190Asp and p.Cys211Tyr. Mutations in GJB6 were detected in 3 % of patients [nine del(GJB6-D13S1830) and three del(GJB6-D13S1854)]. Of the 43 different variations identified in GJB2, 6 were polymorphisms and of the others, 10 (27 %) were truncating and 27 (73 %) were nontruncating. Patients with two truncating mutations had significantly worse hearing impairment than all other groups. Moderate phenotypes were observed in a group of patients carrying biallelic mutations (23 %).

16007150,"Tumor suppressor p53 forms a homo-tetramer through its COOH-terminal oligomerization domain and acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor. We have analysed the interrelation among the transcriptional activities, the structure and the cancer-related mutations in the oligomerization domain by using a comprehensive missense mutation library. Here, we examined the ability of 184 mutant p53s in the domain to form an oligomer by expressing these mutant p53s in yeast, and compared the data with the previous information. We showed that specific residues in the alpha-helix and the beta-strand of the oligomerization domain were critical for both oligomer formation and sequence-specific transactivation, and the activities were closely related. In particular, the alpha-helix was more sensitive to amino-acid substitutions than the beta-strand. We found identity in the interrelation between the two activities, that is, monomer mutants were transcriptionally inactive whereas dimer and tetramer mutants retained their transcriptional activities. In TP53 mutation databases, a small number of mutations have been reported in this domain. Surprisingly, most do not encode p53s defective in functional properties. These results indicate that, although oligomer formation is essential for p53 transactivation function, the inactivation of oligomer formation and therefore the inactivation of transactivation may not be essential for tumor suppression by p53 because they do not lead to oncogenic proteins.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

RNA was extracted from leukocytes and converted into complementary DNA. Overlapping fragments of RYR1 complementary DNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used for double-strand sequencing to find a single mutation likely to be causal of MH susceptibility. Inheritance of the mutation in the family was studied by restriction endonuclease analysis and/or sequencing of genomic DNA and compared to available caffeine halothane contracture test data. The mutation was introduced into rabbit RYR1 complementary DNA, the complementary DNA was expressed in human embryonic kidney line 293 cells, and Ca2+ release by the mutant Ca2+ release channel was measured following the addition of caffeine and halothane.
A novel arginine 328 to tryptophan mutation in RYR1 was detected by direct sequencing of the RYR1 transcript from leukocytes of one MH-susceptible individual. A causal role for this mutation in MH is indicated by cosegregation of the mutation with the MH-susceptible phenotype within the family and by the demonstration that the mutant channel has increased sensitivity to both caffeine and halothane.

27247933,"Hearing loss is a common sensory disorder, and at least 50% of cases are due to a genetic etiology. Although hundreds of genes have been reported to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA are the major contributors. However, the mutation spectrum of these common deafness genes varies among different ethnic groups. The present work summarized mutations in these three genes and their prevalence in 339 patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss at three different special education schools and one children's hospital in Linyi, China. A new multiplex genetic screening system ""SNPscan assay"" was employed to detect a total of 115 mutations of the above three genes. Finally, 48.67% of the patients were identified with hereditary hearing loss caused by mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA. The carrying rate of mutations in the three genes was 37.76%, 19.75%, and 4.72%, respectively. This mutation profile in our study is distinct from other parts of China, with high mutation rate of GJB2 suggesting a unique mutation spectrum in this area.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

20735442,"BRAF, the protein product of BRAF, is a serine/threonine protein kinase and one of the direct downstream effectors of Ras. Somatic mutations in BRAF occur in numerous human cancers, whereas germline BRAF mutations cause cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One recurrent somatic mutation, p.V600E, is frequently found in several tumor types, such as melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. However, a germline mutation affecting codon 600 has never been described. Here, we present a patient with CFC syndrome and a de novo germline mutation involving codon 600 of BRAF, thus providing the first evidence that a pathogenic germline mutation involving this critical codon is not only compatible with development but can also cause the CFC phenotype. In vitro functional analysis shows that this mutation, which replaces a valine with a glycine at codon 600 (p.V600G), leads to increased ERK and ELK phosphorylation compared to wild-type BRAF but is less strongly activating than the cancer-associated p.V600E mutation.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Early diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance can reduce mortality; hence, the disorder is included in the newborn Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in the United States. The Inborn Errors of Metabolism Information System (IBEM-IS) was established in 2007 to collect longitudinal information on individuals with inborn errors of metabolism included in newborn screening (NBS) programs, including VLCAD deficiency. We retrospectively analyzed early outcomes for individuals who were diagnosed with VLCAD deficiency by NBS and describe initial presentations, diagnosis, clinical outcomes and treatment in a cohort of 52 individuals ages 1-18years. Maternal prenatal symptoms were not reported, and most newborns remained asymptomatic. Cardiomyopathy was uncommon in the cohort, diagnosed in 2/52 cases. Elevations in creatine kinase were a common finding, and usually first occurred during the toddler period (1-3years of age). Diagnostic evaluations required several testing modalities, most commonly plasma acylcarnitine profiles and molecular testing.

21687968,"A high performance liquid chromatography method, adapted from an established urinary sugars method, has been developed for the analysis of a tetraglucose oligomer (Glc(4)) in urine. Pompe disease results from defects in the activity of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) with patients typically excreting increased amounts of Glc(4). Rapid determination of GAA in dried blood spots is now possible. However, enzymatic analysis is unable to discriminate between patients with Pompe disease and those individuals harbouring pseudo deficiency mutations. This method was able to quantify Glc(4) levels in all patients analysed with an established diagnosis of Pompe disease, and all controls analysed had Glc(4) levels below the limit of detection for this method. Importantly the method was able to discriminate between an individual known to harbour a pseudo Pompe mutation and patients with Pompe disease, providing a useful supporting test to enzymatic analysis. Sequential measurement of urinary Glc(4) has been proposed to monitor the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We observed a clear decrease in Glc(4) levels following commencement of treatment in three patients studied. Additionally, raised levels of Glc(4) were observed in patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ia and type III suggesting that this method may have applications in other GSDs.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

To gain insight into the role of the calcium-binding domains in alphaIIb biogenesis, we characterized mutations in the second and third calcium-binding domains of alphaIIb in 2 patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. One patient inherited a Val298Phe mutation in the second domain, and the other patient inherited an Ile374Thr mutation in the third domain. Mammalian cell expression studies were performed with normal and mutant alphaIIb and beta3 cDNA constructs. By flow cytometry, expression of alphaIIb Val298Phe/beta3 in transfected cells was 28% of control, and expression of alphaIIbIle374Thr/beta3 was 11% of control. Pulse-chase analyses showed that both mutant pro-alphaIIb subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. Mutagenesis studies of the Val298 and Ile374 residues showed that these highly conserved, branch-chained hydrophobic residues are essential at these positions and that biogenesis and expression of alphaIIbbeta3 is dramatically affected by structural variations in these regions of the calcium-binding domains. Energy calculations derived from a new model of the alphaIIb beta-propeller indicate that these mutations interfere with calcium binding. These data suggest that the alphaIIb calcium-binding domains play a key structural role in the beta-propeller, and that the structural integrity of the calcium-binding domains is critical for integrin biogenesis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

An A-to-G transition at the second base of codon 414 results in the substitution of Cys for Tyr in the mutant PAH protein. In in vitro expression studies, the Tyr414-to-Cys414 mutant construct produced a protein which exhibited a significant amount of normal PAH enzyme activity, which is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo measurements of PAH activity in HPA patients. Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is present on 50% of mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the Danish population. Together with the previously reported codon 158 mutation, these two mutant alleles comprise over 90% of all mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the Northern European population.

A different assay using a specific SHP-2 substrate confirms their decreased PTP activity, but also reveals a significant activity of the T468M mutant.

Exon 2 of GJB2 was screened for coding sequence allele variants by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) complemented by bidirectional sequencing. If two deafness-causing mutations of GJB2 (encoding Connexin 26) were identified, further screening was not performed. If only a single deafness-causing mutation was identified, we screened for the g.1777179_2085947del (hereafter called del(GJB6-D13S1830); GenBank NT_024524.13) and mutations in the noncoding region of GJB2. Phenotype-genotype correlations were evaluated by categorizing mutations as either protein truncating or nontruncating. A total of 205 persons carried two GJB2 exon 2 mutations and were diagnosed as having DFNB1; 100 persons carried only a single deafness-causing allele variant of exon 2. A total of 37 of these persons were c.35delG carriers, and 51 carried other allele variants of GJB2. Persons diagnosed with DFNB1 segregating two truncating/nonsense mutations had a more severe phenotype than persons carrying two missense mutations, with mean hearing impairments being 88 and 37%, respectively (P < 0.05). The number of deaf c.35delG carriers was greater than expected when compared to the c.35delG carrier frequency in normal-hearing controls (P < 0.05), suggesting the existence of at least one other mutation outside the GJB2 coding region that does not complement GJB2 deafness-causing allele variants.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

We evaluated patients with intellectual disability to exclude known causes of the disorder. We then sequenced the coding regions of more than 21,000 genes obtained from 100 patients with an IQ below 50 and their unaffected parents. A data-analysis procedure was developed to identify and classify de novo, autosomal recessive, and X-linked mutations. In addition, we used high-throughput resequencing to confirm new candidate genes in 765 persons with intellectual disability (a confirmation series). All mutations were evaluated by molecular geneticists and clinicians in the context of the patients' clinical presentation.
We identified 79 de novo mutations in 53 of 100 patients. A total of 10 de novo mutations and 3 X-linked (maternally inherited) mutations that had been previously predicted to compromise the function of known intellectual-disability genes were found in 13 patients. Potentially causative de novo mutations in novel candidate genes were detected in 22 patients. Additional de novo mutations in 3 of these candidate genes were identified in patients with similar phenotypes in the confirmation series, providing support for mutations in these genes as the cause of intellectual disability. We detected no causative autosomal recessive inherited mutations in the discovery series. Thus, the total diagnostic yield was 16%, mostly involving de novo mutations.

In order to verify this hypothesis, we surveyed mutations in the SLC26A4(PDS) gene, which were documented to cause enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and Mondini's dysplasia (incomplete partition of the cochlea), in 35 families with various types of inner ear malformations. In 25 families, the probands showed EVA or Mondini's dysplasia as the main temporal bone abnormalities, whereas the probands in the remaining 10 families revealed other types of malformations. In total, 7 mutated SLC26A4 alleles, including 6 missense mutations (A372V, A387V, T410M, S448L, T721M, and H723R) and 1 splice site mutation (IVS7-2A-->G), were detected. All mutated alleles segregated the malformations of EVA and Mondini's dysplasia, whereas no mutated alleles were found in the 10 probands with other types of malformations. SLC26A4 mutations were found in 22 of the 25 probands with EVA or Mondini's dysplasia, indicating that these might be specific to the development of Mondini's dysplasia and EVA.

One of the more distinctive features in childhood is the development of facial warts, often nasolabial and in other moist body surfaces. Individuals with CS have an increased risk of malignancy, suggested to be about 17%. Recently, mutations in the HRAS gene on chromosome 11p13.3 have been found to cause CS.
We report here the results of HRAS analysis in 43 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CS.
Mutations were found in 37 (86%) of patients. Analysis of parental DNA samples was possible in 16 cases for both parents and in three cases for one parent, and confirmed the mutations as de novo in all of these cases. Three novel mutations (G12C, G12E, and K117R) were found in five cases.
These results confirm that CS is caused, in most cases, by heterozygous missense mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS. Analysis of the major phenotypic features by mutation suggests a potential correlation between malignancy risk and genotype, which is highest for patients with an uncommon (G12A) substitution.

In adult patients, PD is characterized by slowly progressive limb-girdle and trunk myopathy and restrictive respiratory insufficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available, improving or stabilizing muscle-function in some and slowing deterioration in other patients. Unfortunately, there is no biomarker available to indicate therapeutic efficacy and/or disease activity. Whole body MRI depicts all skeletal muscles demonstrating foci of atrophic muscles, i.e., late and irreversible pathological changes. Any method indicating the localizations of increased muscle glycogen storage, muscle inflammation and/or degradation could possibly help identifying newly afflicted tissue and may be of prognostic value. We therefore investigated 2-deoxy-2-[18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET, a biomarker for glucose-metabolism, as a tool to evaluate disease activity and prognosis in PD.
In a pilot study, we investigated four patients by FDG dynamic PET/CT while on ERT. One patient had FDG-PET/CT twice, before and after 12 months on ERT. Dynamic FDG-PET/CT quantifies the metabolic rate of glucose utilisation in mg/ml/min. MRI was performed in parallel with pelvic and thigh muscles semi-quantitatively scored for atrophy and disease-activity.
None of the muscles analysed showed a focally increased FDG-uptake. Thus, quantification of muscle glucose metabolism could not be calculated. However, increased FDG-uptake, i.e., increased glucose utilisation, was observed in the respiratory muscles of one patient with severe, restrictive respiratory failure. In contrast, specific MRI sequences showed oedematous as well as atrophic muscle areas in PD.
Our pilot study demonstrates that FDG-uptake does not correlate with glycogen storage in vivo. In contrast, MRI is an excellent tool to demonstrate the extent of muscle involvement. Specific MRI sequences may even demonstrate early changes possibly allowing prognostic predictions or localization of early stages of PD.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

Growing evidence suggests that pancreatic cancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to identify families that could benefit from HBOC or CRC surveillance, but to date pancreatic cancer is only considered an indication for genetic testing in the context of additional family history.
Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital (HCH) included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene panel including both known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66 and 147 pancreatic cancer cases, unselected for family history. Given the strength of preliminary data and corresponding literature, 61 sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent a custom 14-gene clinical panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases, pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselected pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and high probability of pathogenic variants of uncertain significance (HiP-VUS).
Approximately 8.6% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCH carried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately 11.5% carry a pathogenic variant or HiP-VUS.

This study aims to perform a meta-analysis based on the PRISMA statement to evaluate the diagnostic value of SLC26A4 mutant alleles and their correlations with multiethnic hearing phenotypes in EVA patients. The systematic literature search of the PubMed, Wiley Online Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted in English for articles published before July 15, 2015. Two investigators independently reviewed retrieved literature and evaluated eligibility. Discrepancy was resolved by discussion and a third investigator. Quality of included studies was evaluated using Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Data were synthesized using random-effect or fixed-effect models. The effect sizes were estimated by measuring odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-five eligible studies involved 2294 cases with EVA data. A total of 272 SLC26A4 variations were found in deafness with EVA and 26 mutations of SCL26A4 had higher frequency. The overall OR was 646.71 (95% CI: 383.30-1091.15, P = 0.000). A total of 22 mutants were considered statistically significant in all ethnicities (ORs >1, P < 0.05). In particular, 8 mutants were specificity of EVA phenotypes in mutations of SLC26A4 for Asia deafness populations (ORs >1, P < 0.05), 4 mutants for Europe and North America (ORs >1, P < 0.05), and the IVS7-2A>G mutations in SLC26A4 were found to have the highest frequency in deafness individuals with EVA phenotype (62.42%).

We report on 9 fully multimerized recombinant vWFs (rvWFs) expressing type 2M or type 2B von Willebrand disease (vWD) mutations, characterized respectively by a decreased or increased binding of vWF to GPIb in the presence of ristocetin. We expressed 4 type 2M (-G561A, -E596K, -R611H, and -I662F) and 5 type 2B (rvWF-M540MM, -V551F, -V553M, -R578Q, and -L697V). SIPA was strongly impaired in all type 2M rvWFs at 200 and 4000 seconds(-1). Decreased aggregation was correlated with ristocetin binding to platelets. In contrast, a distinct effect of botrocetin was observed, since type 2M rvWFs (-G561A, -E596K, and -I662F) were able to bind to platelets to the same extent as wild type rvWF (rvWF-WT). Interestingly, SIPA at 200 and 4000 seconds(-1) confirmed the gain-of-function phenotype of the 5 type 2B rvWFs. Our data indicated a consistent increase of SIPA at both low and high shear rates, reaching 95% of total platelets, whereas SIPA did not exceed 40% in the presence of rvWF-WT. Aggregation was completely inhibited by monoclonal antibody 6D1 directed to GPIb, underlining the importance of vWF-GPIb interaction in type 2B rvWF. Impaired SIPA of type 2M rvWF could account for the hemorrhagic syndrome observed in type 2M vWD. Increased SIPA of type 2B rvWF could be responsible for unstable aggregates and explain the fluctuant thrombocytopenia of type 2B vWD. (Blood. 2000;95:3796-3803)",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

The remaining mutants have been systematically characterized for loss of wt p53 function, but not other phenotypes. We report the concomitant assessment of loss of function and interference with wt p53 using URA3-based p53 yeast and confirmatory mammalian assays. We studied 76 mutants representing 54% of over 15 000 reported missense core domain mutations. The majority showed the expected complete loss of wt p53 function and dominant p53 inhibition. A few infrequent p53 mutants had wt p53-like activity. Remarkably, one-third showed no interference with wt p53 despite loss of wt p53 function at 37 degrees C. Half of this group consisted of temperature-sensitive p53 mutants, but the other half was surprisingly made up of mutants with complete loss of wt p53 function. Our findings illustrate the diverse behavior of p53 mutants and mechanisms of malignant transformation by p53 mutants. The identification of full-length p53 mutants without dominant inhibition of wt p53 highlights the importance of determining the status of the wt p53 allele in human cancers, in particular in the context of clinical studies. In the case of p53 mutants with no or weak dominant p53 inhibition, presence of the wt allele may indicate a good prognosis cancer, whereas loss of heterozygosity may spell an aggressive, therapy-resistant cancer.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Flow cytometric as well as immunoblot analysis of patient platelets showed significantly reduced levels of GPIIb and GPIIIa compared with a normal control. Patient platelets, however, retained the ability to retract a fibrin clot. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified platelet GPIIb mRNA revealed an Arg327-->His amino acid substitution between the second and third calcium-binding domains of the GPIIb heavy chain, a residue that is highly conserved among integrin alpha-subunits. The recombinant His327 form of GPIIb was found to be fully capable of associating with GPIIIa, therefore the role of the calcium-binding domains in intersubunit association was further examined by constructing amino-terminal segments of GPIIb that ended before the first, second, and third calcium-binding domains. All three fragments were found to associate with GPIIIa, demonstrating that the calcium-binding domains of GPIIb are not necessary for initial complex formation.

12800196,"The causes and functional consequences of E-cadherin (E-CD) loss in breast cancer are poorly understood. E-CD loss might act in concert with alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway to permit oncogenic beta-catenin signaling. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the presence of genetic and epigenetic alterations affecting E-CD (CDH1), APC and beta-catenin (CTNNB1) genes and the immunohistochemical expression of E-CD, beta- and gamma-catenin in a series of 46 infiltrating lobular breast carcinomas (ILCs). Since 80% of ILCs featured complete loss of E-CD expression, we analyzed the molecular alterations responsible for E-CD inactivation in these tumors. We found that 10 of 46 (22%) cases harbored mutations in CDH1, including 1 case with 2 different mutations (1 of which was germline). CDH1 was also inactivated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH; 30/41, 73%) and promoter hypermethylation (19/46, 41%). Interestingly, LOH and mutations were also detected in the corresponding in situ lesions of the ILCs, implying that these alterations are early events in lobular cancer tumorogenesis. Additionally, the presence of a polymorphism in the CDH1 promoter was found to be inversely correlated with CDH1 mutations, but not with E-CD levels. We next examined whether alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway also occurred in the same series of ILCs. Although no CTNNB1 or APC mutations were detected, promoter methylation (25/46, 52%) and LOH (7/30, 23%) of APC were found. Moreover, methylation of APC and CDH1 occurred concordantly. However, beta- and gamma-catenin were severely reduced or absent in 90% of these tumors, implying that alterations in CDH1 and APC genes do not promote beta-catenin accumulation in ILC. These molecular alterations were not associated with microsatellite instability. In summary, several different mechanisms (mutations, LOH, methylation) are involved in the frequent CDH1 inactivation in invasive and in situ lobular breast cancer. The same tumors also show genetic and epigenetic alterations of APC gene. However, altered CDH1 and APC genes do not promote beta-catenin accumulation in this tumor type.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

About 50% of BRRS and >80% of CD demonstrate germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor and dual phosphatase, PTEN. Germ-line mutation of PTEN as a cause for JPS in a child is controversial because extraintestinal manifestations that would exclude JPS could appear after adolescence, altering the clinical diagnosis. Here, we investigated a family in which the 55-year-old father, who lacks thyroid or skin findings characteristic of CD, demonstrated a germ-line mutation in PTEN that was passed to identical twin daughters, who both manifested JPS. The mutation was a deletion of five bases beginning seven bases from the start of exon 4 of PTEN, which caused aberrant transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR that were absent from a normal individual. Thus, mutations in PTEN are associated with JPS in addition to CD and some BRRS families, although the incidence of PTEN germ-line mutations in JPS might be more rare than that reported for SMAD4, a gene found to be mutated in approximately one-half of the JPS families investigated.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
25097241,"The purpose of this study was to establish a fully validated, high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for comprehensive, cost-effective, clinical molecular diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
Target sequences of a panel of 66 genes known to cause all nonsyndromic and a few syndromic forms of RP were enriched by using custom-designed probe hybridization. A total of 939 coding exons and 20 bp of their flanking intron regions with a total of 202,800 bp of target sequences were captured, followed by massively parallel sequencing (MPS) on the Illumina HiSeq2000 device.
Twelve samples with known mutations were used for test validation. We achieved an average sequence depth of ∼1000× per base. Exons with <20× insufficient coverage were completed by PCR/Sanger sequencing to ensure 100% coverage. We analyzed DNA from 65 unrelated RP patients and detected deleterious mutations in 53 patients with a diagnostic yield of ∼82%.
Clinical validation and consistently deep coverage of individual exons allow for the accurate identification of all types of mutations including point mutations, exonic deletions, and large insertions. Our comprehensive MPS approach greatly improves diagnostic acumen for RP in a cost- and time-efficient manner.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,

17056636,"Noonan syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) and Costello syndrome constitute a group of developmental disorders with an overlapping pattern of congenital anomalies. Each of these conditions can be caused by germline mutations in key components of the highly conserved Ras-MAPK pathway, possibly reflecting a similar pathogenesis underlying the three disorders. Germline mutations in KRAS have recently been identified in a small number of patients with Noonan syndrome and CFC.
260 patients were screened for KRAS mutations by direct sequencing. Overall, we detected KRAS mutations in 12 patients, including three known and eight novel sequence alterations. All mutations are predicted to cause single amino acid substitutions. Remarkably, our cohort of individuals with KRAS mutations showed a high clinical variability, ranging from Noonan syndrome to CFC, and also included two patients who met the clinical criteria of Costello syndrome.
Our findings reinforce the picture of a clustered distribution of disease associated KRAS germline alterations. We further defined the phenotypic spectrum associated with KRAS missense mutations and provided the first evidence of clinical differences in patients with KRAS mutations compared with Noonan syndrome affected individuals with heterozygous PTPN11 mutations and CFC patients carrying a BRAF, MEK1 or MEK1 alteration, respectively. We speculate that the observed phenotypic variability may be related, at least in part, to specific genotypes and possibly reflects the central role of K-Ras in a number of different signalling pathways.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
11738358,"Glycogen storage disease type II is an autosomal recessive muscle disorder due to deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase and the resulting intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen. We found six novel mutations in three Spanish classic infantile onset glycogen storage disease type II patients with involvement of both cardiac and skeletal muscle; three missense mutations (G219R, E262K, M408V), a nonsense mutation (Y191X), a donor splice site mutation (IVS18 +2gt>ga) and an in frame deletion of an asparagine residue (nt1408-1410). The missense mutations were not found in 100 normal chromosomes and therefore are not normal polymorphic variants. The splice site mutation was subsequently detected in an additional 'Spanish' infantile onset glycogen storage disease type II patient from El Salvador. Further studies will be required to determine if the IVS18 +2gt>ga splice site mutation might in fact be a relatively common Spanish mutation. Mutations among Spanish glycogen storage disease type II patients appear to be genetically heterogeneous and differ from common mutations in neighboring countries.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
28513614,"Germline variants within the transcription factor RUNX1 are associated with familial platelet disorder and acute leukemia in over 40% of carriers. At present, the somatic events triggering leukemic transformation appear heterogeneous and profiles of leukemia initiation across family members are poorly defined. We report a new RUNX1 family where three sisters harboring a germline nonsense RUNX1 variant, c.601C>T (p.(Arg201*)), developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML) at 5 years of age. Whole-exome sequencing of tumor samples revealed all three siblings independently acquired variants within the JAK-STAT pathway, specifically targeting JAK2 and SH2B3 (a negative regulator of JAK2), while also sharing the 46/1 haplotype linked with sporadic JAK2-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms. In-depth chromosomal characterization of tumors revealed acquired copy number gains and uniparental disomy amplifying RUNX1, JAK2 and SH2B3 variants, highlighting the significance of co-operation between these disrupted pathways. One sibling, presenting with myelodysplasia at 14 years, had no evidence of clonal or subclonal JAK2 or SH2B3 variants, suggesting the latter were specifically associated with leukemic transformation in her sisters. Collectively, the clinical and molecular homogeneity across these three young siblings provides the first notable example of convergent AML evolution in a RUNX1 pedigree, with the recurrent acquisition of JAK-STAT pathway variants giving rise to high-risk AML, characterized by chemotherapy resistance and relapse.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
7796500,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy of unknown etiology. Missense mutations of the cardiac beta-myosin-heavy-chain (beta-MHC) gene that may be responsible for cardiac hypertrophy have been detected in patients with HCM. On the other hand, gross structural abnormalities in the cardiac beta-MHC gene, ie, an alpha/beta hybrid gene and partial deletion of the gene, have also been reported. The direct correlation between gross abnormalities and development of HCM is not well understood.
We analyzed the structure of the cardiac beta-MHC gene from patients with HCM by using polymerase chain reaction-DNA conformation polymorphism analysis and found two sequence variations in exons 3 and 22 in one patient. These sequence variations at codon 54 (exon 3; nonsense mutation) and codon 870 (exon 22; Arg-to-His mutation) were identified by direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. Relatives of this patient were examined for the mutations. It was revealed that the missense mutation was inherited from the affected father and the nonsense mutation from the unaffected grandmother through the unaffected mother. In addition, the missense mutation was also found in seven other patients from two other unrelated multiplex HCM families.
The Arg870His mutation was suggested to cause HCM. In contrast, the gene with the nonsense mutation would encode for a cardiac beta-MHC protein of only 53 amino acid residues, which may be too short to be incorporated into the thick filament assembly of cardiac myosin chains and showed no dominant phenotype of heart disease. This is the first report of a nonsense mutation in the human cardiac beta-MHC gene.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,

Several recent studies applied targeted genome enrichment (TGE) and massively parallel sequencing (MPS) to simultaneously screen a large set of known hearing loss (HL) genes. However, most of these studies were focused on familial cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of TGE and MPS on screening sporadic NSHL patients, we recruited 63 unrelated sporadic NSHL probands, who had various levels of HL and were excluded for mutations in GJB2, MT-RNR1, and SLC26A4 genes. TGE and MPS were performed on 131 known HL genes using the Human Deafness Panel oto-DA3 (Otogenetics Corporation., Norcross, GA). We identified 14 pathogenic variants in STRC, CATSPER2, USH2A, TRIOBP, MYO15A, GPR98, and TMPRSS3 genes in eight patients (diagnostic rate = 12.7%). Among these variants, 10 were novel compound heterozygous mutations.

Information about the carrier frequencies of mutations that underlie autosomal recessive disorders is indispensable for accurate genetic counseling to predict the probability of patients' children's disease. However, there have been few reports specific to the Japanese population. GJB2 mutations are reported to be the most frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss, and the mutation spectrum and frequency of GJB2 mutations were reported to vary among different ethnic groups. In this study, we investigated the carrier frequency of GJB2 mutations and the mutation spectrum in 509 individuals randomly selected from the general Japanese population. We show that the carrier frequencies of the two most common pathogenic mutations are 1.57% (8/509) for c.235delC and 1.77% (9/509) for p.Val37Ile. In addition to these mutations, we found two pathogenic variants (p.[Gly45Glu;Tyr136*] and p.Arg143Trp), and the total carrier frequency was estimated to be around 3.73% (19/509). We also detected six unclassified variants, including two novel variants (p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu), with the former predicted to be pathogenic. These findings will provide indispensable information for genetic counseling in the Japanese population.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
18427545,"Germline mutations in the gene encoding the tumour suppressor E-cadherin (CDH1) are the underlying genetic defect responsible for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). A remarkably high percentage ( approximately 80%) of CDH1 mutations in HDGC patients and carriers generate premature termination codons (PTCs). Here, we examined whether CDH1 transcripts harbouring PTCs are downregulated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an RNA surveillance pathway that degrades PTC-bearing transcripts. Using an allele-specific expression (ASE) assay to differentiate between mutated and wild-type CDH1 alleles, we found that PTC-bearing CDH1 mRNAs are strongly downregulated in normal gastric tissue from several CDH1 mutation carriers. We show that NMD is responsible for this robust downregulation, as CDH1 transcripts harbouring PTCs in the KATO-III gastric tumour cell line were upregulated in response to protein synthesis inhibitors or depletion of the NMD factors UPF1 and eIF4AIII. Analysis of HDGC patients harbouring CDH1 alleles with PTCs at a wide variety of different positions indicates an association of their predicted ability to induce NMD and an earlier age of onset of gastric cancer. This suggests that NMD may be detrimental for HDGC patients and therefore NMD is a potentially useful therapeutic target for CDH1 mutation carriers.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

However, a concomitant evaluation of autoimmune diseases and an assessment of multiple autoantibodies in a large population of patients with molecularly confirmed RASopathy have not been performed. The clinical and laboratory features were analyzed in 42 RASopathy patients, the majority of whom had NS and five individuals had Noonan-related disorders. The following autoantibodies were measured: Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1, anti-ribosomal P, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), thyroid, anti-smooth muscle, anti-endomysial (AE), anti-liver cytosolic protein type 1 (LC1), anti-parietal cell (APC), anti-mitochondrial (AM) antibodies, anti-liver-kidney microsome type 1 antibodies (LKM-1), and lupus anticoagulant. Six patients (14%) fulfilled the clinical criteria for autoimmune diseases [systemic lupus erythematous, polyendocrinopathy (autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease), primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), autoimmune hepatitis, vitiligo, and autoimmune thyroiditis]. Autoimmune antibodies were observed in 52% of the patients. Remarkably, three (7%) of the patients had specific gastrointestinal and liver autoantibodies without clinical findings. Autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies were frequently present in patients with RASopathies.

22308022,"The β3 subunit of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 integrins contains four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Each domain harbors four disulfide bonds of which one is unique for integrins. We previously discerned a regulatory role of the EGF-4 Cys-560-Cys-583 unique bond for αIIbβ3 activation. In this study we further investigated the role of all four integrin unique bonds in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. We created β3 mutants harboring serine substitutions of each or both cysteines that disrupt the four unique bonds (Cys-437-Cys-457 in EGF-1, Cys-473-Cys-503 in EGF-2, Cys-523-Cys-544 in EGF-3, and Cys-560-Cys-583 in EGF-4) and transfected them into baby hamster kidney cells together with normal αv or αIIb. Flow cytometry was used to measure surface expression of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and their activity state by soluble fibrinogen binding. Most cysteine substitutions caused similarly reduced surface expression of both receptors. Disrupting all four unique disulfide bonds by single cysteine substitutions resulted in variable constitutive activation of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. In contrast, whereas double C437S/C457S and C473S/C503S mutations yielded constitutively active αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, the C560S/C583S mutation did not, and the C523S/C544S mutation only yielded constitutively active αIIbβ3. Activation of C523S/C544S αvβ3 mutant by activating antibody and dithiothreitol was also impaired. Molecular dynamics of C523S/C544S β3 in αIIbβ3 but not in αvβ3 displayed an altered stable conformation. Our findings indicate that unique disulfide bonds in β3 differently affect the function of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and suggest a free sulfhydryl-dependent regulatory role for Cys-560-Cys-583 in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and for Cys-523-Cys-544 only in αvβ3.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

PKU has wide allelic heterogeneity, and over 600 different disease-causing mutations in PAH have been detected to date. Up to now, there have been no reports on the minihaplotype (VNTR/STR) analysis of PAH locus in the Iranian population. The aims of the present study were to determine PAH mutations and minihaplotypes in Iranian families with PAH deficiency and to investigate the correlation between them. A total of 81 Iranian families with PAH deficiency were examined using PCR-sequencing of all 13 PAH exons and their flanking intron regions to identify sequence variations. Fragment analysis of the PAH minihaplotypes was performed by capillary electrophoresis for 59 families. In our study, 33 different mutations were found accounting for 95% of the total mutant alleles. The majority of these mutations (72%) were distributed across exons 7, 11, 2 and their flanking intronic regions. Mutation c.1066-11G > A was the most common with a frequency of 20.37%. The less frequent mutations, p.Arg261Gln (8%), p.Arg243Ter (7.4%), p.Leu48Ser (7.4%), p.Lys363Asnfs*37 (6.79%), c.969 + 5G > A (6.17%), p.Pro281Leu (5.56), c.168 + 5G > C (5.56), and p.Arg261Ter (4.94) together comprised about 52% of all mutant alleles. In this study, a total of seventeen PAH gene minihaplotypes were detected, six of which associated exclusively with particular mutations. Our findings indicate a broad PAH mutation spectrum in the Iranian population, which is consistent with previous studies reporting a wide range of PAH mutations, most likely due to ethnic heterogeneity. High prevalence of c.1066-11G > A mutation linked to minihaplotype 7/250 among both Iranian and Mediterranean populations is indicative of historical and geographical links between them.

We describe a patient in whom clinical and laboratory findings typical of type I GT were found together with a second pathology involving neurological and other complications symptomatic of tuberous sclerosis. Analysis of platelet proteins by Western blotting revealed trace amounts of normally migrating GPIIb and equally small amounts of GPIIIa of slightly slower than normal migration. Flow cytometry confirmed a much decreased binding to platelets of monoclonal antibodies to GPIIb, GPIIIa or GPIIb-IIIa, and an antibody to the alphav subunit also showed decreased binding. Nonradioactive PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments showed a homozygous point mutation (T to C) at nucleotide 1722 of GPIIIa cDNA and which led to a Cys542-->Arg substitution in the GPIIIa protein. The mutation gave rise to a HinP1 I restriction site in exon 11 of the GPIIIa gene and allele-specific restriction enzyme analysis of family members confirmed that a single mutated allele was inherited from each parent. This amino acid substitution presumably changes the capacity for disulphide bond formation within the cysteine-rich core region of GPIIIa and its study will provide new information on GPIIb-IIIa and alphavbeta3 structure and biosynthesis.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to improve survival, cardiac mass, and motor skills. In this work, we aim to illustrate the genotypes of IOPD and the outcome of ERT in our population. The medical records of infants with confirmed diagnosis of IOPD who received ERT were reviewed. Eighteen infants (7 males, 11 females) were included in the study. The median age at presentation was 2 months and the median age at the start of ERT was 4.5 months. Fifteen (83.3%) infants died with a median age at death of 12 months. The 3 alive infants (whose current ages are 6½ years, 6 years, and 10 years), who were initiated on ERT at the age of 3 weeks, 5 months, and 8 months respectively, has had variable response with requirement of assisted ventilation in one child and tracheostomy in another child.

Three patients with GSD II were recruited based on clinical and biochemical findings. Alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity was determined and the GAA gene sequence was analyzed by PCR and sequencing. We also collected information about the genotypes of Korean patients with GSD II from the medical literature.

We transferred mitochondria harboring these mutations into human cells lacking endogenous mtDNA (rho o cells), and analyzed the resulting transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines for the relationship of genotype to phenotype. Cybrids containing high levels of mutated genomes showed decreased rates of synthesis of mitochondrial translation products, reduced respiratory chain function, and increased amounts of a novel unprocessed RNA species (RNA 19). Overall effects on mitochondrial functions were more severe for the MELAS 3243 cybrids as compared to the MELAS 3271 cybrids.

Myosin was isolated and studied using an in vitro motility assay. The distribution of myosin light chain-1 isoforms was measured by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation was measured by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain.
The fraction of actin filaments moving when powered by myectomy myosin was 21% less than with donor myosin (P = 0.006), whereas the sliding speed was not different (0.310 +/- 0.034 for myectomy myosin vs. 0.305 +/- 0.019 microm/s for donor myosin in six paired experiments). Failing heart myosin showed 18% reduced motility. One myectomy myosin sample produced a consistently higher sliding speed than donor heart myosin and was identified with a disease-causing heavy chain mutation (V606M). In myectomy myosin, the level of atrial light chain-1 relative to ventricular light chain-1 was 20 +/- 5% compared with 11 +/- 5% in donor heart myosin and the level of myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation was decreased by 30-45%. Isolated cardiomyocytes showed reduced contraction amplitude (1.61 +/- 0.25 vs. 3.58 +/- 0.40%) and reduced relaxation rates compared with donor myocytes (TT(50%) = 0.32 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.02 s).
Contractility in myectomy samples resembles the hypocontractile phenotype found in end-stage failing heart muscle irrespective of the primary stimulus, and this phenotype is not a direct effect of the hypertrophy-inducing mutation.

We have validated this approach in a cohort of 95 samples with the previously known PAH, GCH1, PTS, and QDPR mutations and one control sample. Pooled barcoded DNA libraries were enriched using a custom NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice array and sequenced using a HiSeq2000 sequencer. The combination of several robust bioinformatics tools allowed us to detect all known pathogenic mutations (point mutations, short insertions/deletions, and large genomic rearrangements) in the 95 samples, without detecting spurious calls in these genes in the control sample. We then used the same capture assay in a discovery cohort of 11 uncharacterized HPA patients using a MiSeq sequencer. In addition, we report the precise characterization of the breakpoints of four genomic rearrangements in PAH, including a novel deletion of 899 bp in intron 3.

The patient inherited a maternal allele carrying the Met124Val substitution and a paternal allele that changes Asp119 to Tyr. Phenotyping of the human platelet antigen 1 (HPA-1) showed that the platelet alphaIIbbeta3 complex in the patient was mostly accounted for by the Asp 119Tyr allele that does not bind to fibrinogen (Fg). The patient showed agonistinduced binding of platelets to Fg but neither binding to PAC-1 nor cell aggregation could be detected, most likely due to the minute expression (< or = 5%) of alphaIIb(124Val)beta3 receptors. CHO cells expressing (124Val)beta3 showed a diminished surface expression of alphaIIbbeta3, enhanced adhesion to immobilized Fg, and spontaneous aggregation in the presence of soluble Fg, suggesting that (124Val)beta3 may confer constitutive activity to the alphaIIb(124Val)beta3 receptors. A distinct feature of these cells is the failure of DTT to enhance the binding to soluble Fg and the formation of cell aggregates. The substitution of (124Met)beta3 by either a polar or a positively charged amino acid restored the surface exposure and function of the alphaIIbbeta3 receptors whereas a negatively charged residue did not.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
26123647,"Nonsyndromic orofacial cleft (NSOFC) is a complex disease of still unclear genetic etiology. To investigate the contribution of rare epithelial cadherin (CDH1) gene variants to NSOFC, we target sequenced 221 probands. Candidate variants were evaluated via in vitro, in silico, or segregation analyses. Three probably pathogenic variants (c.760G>A [p.Asp254Asn], c.1023T>G [p.Tyr341*], and c.2351G>A [p.Arg784His]) segregated according to autosomal dominant inheritance in four nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) families (Lod score: 5.8 at θ = 0; 47% penetrance). A fourth possibly pathogenic variant (c.387+5G>A) was also found, but further functional analyses are needed (overall prevalence of CDH1 candidate variants: 2%; 15.4% among familial cases). CDH1 mutational burden was higher among probands from familial cases when compared to that of controls (P = 0.002). We concluded that CDH1 contributes to NSCL/P with mainly rare, moderately penetrant variants, and CDH1 haploinsufficiency is the likely etiological mechanism.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
35699829,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a common mitochondrial disease. More than 30 variants in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been previously described in LHON. However, the pathogenicity of some variants remains unclear. Herein, we report a 19-year-old boy presenting unique LHON plus dystonia syndrome with the rare m.4136A > G and m.4160 T > C variants and elucidate the molecular pathomechanisms of the m.4160 T > C mutation.
We performed clinical, molecular genetic analysis, and biochemical investigation in the patient's different tissues and cybrid cell lines.
The optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the patient showed typical pathological changes-a significant decrease in the 17 thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the ganglion cell complex (GCC). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found noteworthy abnormal signals in the basal ganglia region. The genetic analysis revealed that the m.4160 T > C variant was heteroplasmic in the blood (80.2%), urine sediment (90.8%), and oral mucosal (81.7%) samples of the patient. In contrast, the m.4136A > G variant was homoplasmic in all available tissues. Biochemical and bioenergetic investigations showed decreased mitochondrial protein levels and mitochondrial respiration deficiency in cybrid cells harboring these variants.
This research provided more comprehensive data to help gain insight into the pathogenicity of the m.4160 T > C variant and broaden our view on the LHON plus phenotype.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
17612745,"The clinical profile and prognosis of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a primary cardiac muscle disease caused mostly by mutations in sarcomeric protein-encoding genes, have been linked to particular disease-causing mutations in the past. However, such associations are often based on cross-sectional observations, as longitudinal studies of the progression of the disease in genotypically defined patients are sparse. Most importantly, the relative contribution of age, gender and genetic cause to disease profile and progression has not yet been reported, and the question remains whether one or more of these factors could mask the effect of the other(s).
We previously described cross-sectional family studies of two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-causing mutations, R92W(TNNT2) and R403W(MYH7), both associated with minimal hypertrophy, but with widely different life expectancies. We re-investigated 22 and 26 R92W(TNNT2) and R403W(MYH7) mutation carriers in these and additional South African R92W(TNNT2) families after a mean 11.08 +/- 2.79 years, and compared the influence of the two mutations, in the context of age and gender, on disease progression.
We demonstrated a positive correlation between age and interventricular septal thickness for both mutations, with more than a third of all mutation carriers developing clinically recognised hypertrophy only after the age of 35 years. This period of hypertrophically silent HCM also coincided with the years in which most sudden cardiac deaths occurred, particularly in male R92W(TNNT2) carriers. Statistical analyses indicated that the particular mutation was the strongest determinant of left ventricular remodelling; particularly, LVESD increased and EF reduction was noted in the majority of R403W(MYH7) carriers, which may require clinical follow-up over the longer term.
Statistical modelling of follow-up data suggests that an interplay between unidentified, possibly gender-associated factors, and the causal mutation are the determinants of eventual cardiac function and survival, but not of the extent of hypertrophy, and emphasises the need for long-term follow-up even in individuals with apparently mild disease.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,0,
15322508,"There were an estimated 10 million new cases, 6 million deaths and 22 million persons living with cancer in the year 2000. The most common cancers are, in terms of new cases, lung (1.2 million), breast (1.05 million), colon-rectum (945 000), stomach (876 000) and liver (564 000). The geographic distributions of some 20 types of cancer for which national estimates have been made are summarized. These patterns are examined with respect to the likely reasons in terms of variation in exposure to carcinogens (in the external environment or through lifestyle choices) or in genetic susceptibility to them. Related data from studies of migrant populations (that allow comparisons of genetically similar populations living in different environments) and from comparisons between different ethnic groups living in the same country are used to help in the interpretation of the geographic patterns. Information on the burden of disease also has a very important role in the planning and monitoring of programmes of cancer control.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
20228067,"Mutations in the COCH (coagulation factor C homology) gene have been attributed to DFNA9 (deafness, autosomal-dominant 9), an autosomal-dominant non-syndromic hearing loss disorder. However, the mechanisms responsible for DFNA9 hearing loss remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mutant cochlin, the protein product of the COCH gene, forms a stable dimer that is sensitive to reducing agent. In contrast, wild-type (WT) cochlin may form only dimers transiently. Interestingly, the presence of mutant cochlin can stabilize WT cochlin in dimer conformation, providing a possible mechanism for the dominant nature of DFNA9 mutations. Furthermore, the expression of mutant cochlin eventually induces WT cochlin to form stable oligomers that are resistant to reducing agent. Finally, we show that mutant cochlin is cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Our study suggests a possible molecular mechanism underlying DFNA9 hearing loss and provides an in vitro model that may be used to explore protein-misfolding diseases in general.",non_PS3_BS3,0,1,,1,
30214072,"To investigate immune tolerance induction with transient low-dose methotrexate (TLD-MTX) initiated with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA), in treatment-naïve cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM)-positive infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) patients.
Newly diagnosed IOPD patients received subcutaneous or oral 0.4 mg/kg TLD-MTX for 3 cycles (3 doses/cycle) with the first 3 rhGAA infusions. Anti-rhGAA IgG titers, classified as high-sustained (HSAT; ≥51,200, ≥2 times after 6 months), sustained intermediate (SIT; ≥12,800 and <51,200 within 12 months), or low (LT; ≤6400 within 12 months), were compared with those of 37 CRIM-positive IOPD historic comparators receiving rhGAA alone.
Fourteen IOPD TLD-MTX recipients at the median age of 3.8 months (range, 0.7-13.5 months) had a median last titer of 150 (range, 0-51,200) at median rhGAA duration ~83 weeks (range, 36-122 weeks). One IOPD patient (7.1%) developed titers in the SIT range and one patient (7.1%) developed titers in the HSAT range. Twelve of the 14 patients (85.7%) that received TLD-MTX remained LT, versus 5/37 HSAT (peak 51,200-409,600), 7/37 SIT (12,800-51,000), and 23/37 LT (200-12,800) among comparators.
Results of TLD-MTX coinitiated with rhGAA are encouraging and merit a larger longitudinal study.",non_PS3_BS3,0,0,,0,
